Things specific to layouts
==========================

AASTeX

No support for table notes. They could be implemented through <footnoteref>, but it becomes a nightmare to ensure xml:id uniqueness (the only ID available here is in the inset; mix it with the table ID?). Anyway, it would require a lot of specific code to make it work, probably not worth the effort right now. 

	Related parts of the layout: 
		Style "Table note"
		InsetLayout "Flex:tablenotemark"
	Alreayd used in the following test: 
		bibliography_precooked_aastex.lyx
		
Notion of MathLetters: a group of equations. No good mapping in DocBook, maybe an informalgroup? To discuss with DocBook TC. 
TableRefs, TableComments: no mapping in DocBook, not really a way to add these things. To discuss with DocBook TC. 

Clearly, with this kind of template, we're reaching the limits of such a system! Having a really good converter for all these cases would require a lot of very specific code. 

More general: what the heck with appendices? It's not handled in the LyX way (Document > Start Appendix Here), but in a custom way. Making this work would solve some correctness issues with this template. 



Things specific to modules
==========================

AMS

Theorems and the like do not have counter parts in DocBook. Maybe a <formalpara> could do the trick, but I'd need to find a way to shoehorn a title through the styles (i.e. a first complete tag): 

	LyX:
		Theorem: Bla bla

	DocBook:
		<formalpara>
			<title>Theorem</title>
			<para>Bla bla</para>
		</formalpara>

This would also only be a solution for single-paragraph things, as formalpara only allows one paragraph. Or a sidebar, but it's semantically very remote.
