This file describes tests that might be useful to implement.

- lyx2lyx tests
  One way to implemente tests of lyx2lyx is to do a roundtrip lyx2lyx
  conversion (e.g. with the previous major release format) and then compare the
  exported .tex files before and after. Ideally there should be no change.
