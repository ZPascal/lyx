   Flattening macros. Sometimes it's annoying the fact that once you have
 written a macro, you can't touch at it's "constant parts". I call flattening
 to the process of substituting all macros with LaTeX code.

   Task: designing a macro substitution system that reads from a file
 (possibly the same file as the document's) the macros and parses the document
 doing the appropriate replacements

  This is very useful, because sometimes you have a big expression in a macro
 and you want to change an index only. What do you do then?. You retype
 everything (perhaps several times in the document) or you create extremely
 generic and parametrizable macros that aren't very fast to fill in the
 majority of cases.
