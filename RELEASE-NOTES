Changes with respect to external programs and libraries:
--------------------------------------------------------


- LyX is not yet supposed to work with Qt5. It is advised to compile and 
  run LyX against Qt 4.8.x. On Windows, Qt 4.8.5 suffers from a bug that 
  breaks the use of shortcuts, so on Windows Qt 4.8.4 is advised.


Known issues in version 2.2.0
-----------------------------

- LyX needs to be run under Python 2 and will not work properly on systems
  where Python 3 is the default binary. See bug #7030 to know how to fix
  this properly, since simple sheebang conversion in *.py files will not
  be enough.
