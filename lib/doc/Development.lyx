\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual documents some aspects of \SpecialChar LyX
 development.
 It is currently rather incomplete, but will hopefully be extended in the
 future.
 Meanwhile, additional information can be found in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
development
\end_layout

\end_inset

 subfolder of the \SpecialChar LyX
 source code distribution.
 This document is not translated, since the development language of \SpecialChar LyX
 is
 english.
 If you want to use \SpecialChar LyX
 you don't need to read this manual.
 However, if you want to learn more about how \SpecialChar LyX
 is developed, or even want
 to participate in \SpecialChar LyX
 development, you may find some interesting information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
File formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 uses several custom file formats for configuration files and documents.
 This chapter contains some background concerning these file formats.
 Several file formats are also described in detail in the regular user documenta
tion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
File Format Numbers

When is an update of the .lyx file format number needed?
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:When-is-an"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are working on a new feature you may ask yourself whether it needs
 an update of the .lyx file format number.
 Whether an update is needed or not is not always obvious.
 Below you can find a list of reasons for file format updates with explanations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
New
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

document
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

setting Whenever you introduce a new setting that is stored in the document
 header, a file format update is needed.
 This is also true if you add a new valid value to an existing setting,
 e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

a new language that is stored in 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
language
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Removed
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

document
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

setting If a certain setting becomes obsolete and gets removed, a file format
 update is needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
New
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

inset Of course a new inset requires a file format update.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
New
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

style in any layout file or module shipped with \SpecialChar LyX
, or new shipped layout
 file or module.
 These requirements are currently under discussion and might change in the
 future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Automatically
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

loaded
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

math
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

package Any new math package that is automatically loaded needs a file format
 update.
 The reason for this is that there is no true ERT inset for math formulas:
 Each command is parsed, and if a user happens to defne a local command
 with the same name as a command that triggers an automatic load of a package,
 he needs to be able to switch off the automatic loading of that package.
 This switch is stored by the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
use_package
\end_layout

\end_inset

 header setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are still unsure, please ask on the development list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How to update the file format number of .lyx files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you came to the conclusion that a file format update is needed you
 should use the following procedure to perform the update:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Implement and test the new feature, including the reading and writing of
 .lyx files.
 Note that any file produced at this stage does not use a valid format,
 so do not use this version of \SpecialChar LyX
 for working on any important documents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Describe the new format in 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 file format number in

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Add an entry to both format lists (for conversion and reversion) in
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
lib/lyx2lyx/lyx_2_2.py
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Add a conversion routine if needed (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

a new header setting always needs a conversion that adds the new setting,
 a new document language does not need one).
 Add a reversion routine if needed.
 While the conversion routine is required to produce a document that is
 equivalent to the old version, the requirements of the reversion are not
 that strict.
 If possible, try to produce a proper reversion, using ERT if needed, but
 for some features this might be too complicated.
 In this case, the minimum requirement of the reversion routine is that
 it produces a valid document which can be read by an older \SpecialChar LyX
.
 If absolutely needed, even data loss is allowed for the reversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since tex2lyx has several implicit file format dependencies caused by sharing
 code with \SpecialChar LyX
, updating the file format of .lyx files produced by tex2lyx at
 the same time as updating the main .lyx file format is strongly recommended.
 Therefore, a compiler warning will be issued if the \SpecialChar LyX
 and tex2lyx .lyx file
 format numbers differ.
 In many cases the tex2lyx update requires only the first and last item
 of the list below:
\begin_inset Separator parbreak
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Update the tex2lyx file format number in 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/version.h
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the lyx2lyx conversion from the old to the new format is empty, or if
 tex2lyx does not yet output the changed feature, you do not need any further
 tex2lyx changes.
 Otherwise, search for the changed feature in tex2lyx, and adjust the output
 according to the lyx2lyx changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Update the tex2lyx test references as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Updating-test-references"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If you did not implement full tex2lyx support of the new feature, add a
 line to 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx/TODO.txt
\end_layout

\end_inset

 describing the missing bits.
 Note that it is perfectly fine if you do not add full tex2lyx support for
 a new feature: The updating recommendation above is only issued for the
 syntax of the produced .lyx file.
 It is no problem if some features supported by \SpecialChar LyX
 are still output as ERT
 by tex2lyx, since the problems in the past that resulted in the update
 recommendation were related to mixed version syntax, not ERT.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It would be nice if you could create a .lyx test file which contains instances
 of all changed or added features.
 This could then be used to test lyxl2yx and tex2lyx.
 Unfortunately it has not yet been decided how to collect such examples,
 so please ask on the development list if you want to create one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Backporting new styles to the stable version
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting with the stable \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1 branch, there is a mechanism in place to backport
 new styles to the stable version without the need to update the file format.
 The basic idea is that the new style definition is automatically copied
 to the document preamble, so that it can even be used by older minor revisions
 that did not yet include the style.
 To backport a new style to the stable version, the following steps are
 needed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Add the line 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ForceLocal -1
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to the style definition in the development version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Copy the style definition to the stable version, but use 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ForceLocal 1
\end_layout

\end_inset

 instead.
 If needed adjust the format to the one used by the stable version (see
 the customization manual for details of the layout file format).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For each update of the style in a later stable version, increase the argument
 of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ForceLocal
\end_layout

\end_inset

 by one (in the stable version, the development version should not be touched).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For details about the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 flag see the customization manual.
 No 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
lyx2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 support is needed for backported styles: Since the style of the development
 version has an infinite version number, it will always be used.
 Furthermore, since its version number is less than one, the style will
 not be written anymore to the document header for files saved by the new
 version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Automated tests are an important tool to detect bugs and regressions in
 software development.
 Some projects like gcc even require each bug fix to be accompanied by a
 test case for the automatic test suite, that would detect this bug.
 Testing interactive features automatically is of course very hard, but
 core functionality like document import and export can be tested quite
 easily, and some tests of this kind exist.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx/test
\end_layout

 The actual testing is performed by the simple python script 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx/test/runtests.py
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Each test consists of two files: 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
<test name>.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 contains the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 code that should be tested.
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
<test name>.lyx.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 contains the expected output of tex2lyx.
 When a test is run, the actual produced output is compared with the stored
 reference output.
 The test passes if both are identical.
 The test machinery is also able to generate a file 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
<test name>.lyx.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 by exporting the produced .lyx file with \SpecialChar LyX
 again.
 This may be useful for roundtrip comparisons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Running the tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tex2lyx tests can be run by the commands 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_inset

 (cmake) or 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 subfolder of the build directory.
 If a test fails, the differences between the expected and actual results
 are output in unified diff format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Updating test references
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases a changed tex2lyx output is not a test failure, but wanted,
 e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

if a tex2lyx bug was fixed, or a new feature was added.
 In these cases the stored references need to be updated.
 To do so if using autotools, call 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
make updatetests
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 subdirectory of the build directory.
 If instead using CMake, call 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
make updatetex2lyxtests
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in the build directory or in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx/test
\end_layout

\end_inset

 subdirectory of the build directory
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that this is a case where a make target in the build directory can
 affect the source directory, which might not be advisable.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 For convenience, these commands also produce re-exported roundtrip .lyx.tex
 files.
 Please examine the changed output carefully before committing the changed
 files to the repository: Since the test machinery does not do a roundtrip
 test .tex 
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow$
\end_inset

 .lyx 
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow$
\end_inset

 .tex, and does not compare the produced dvi or pdf output, it assumes that
 the stored .lyx reference produces correct output if processed by \SpecialChar LyX
.
 There is only one chance to detect wrong output: before committing a new
 reference.
 Once it is committed, it is quite difficult to verify whether it is correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please 
\emph on
do not
\emph default
 update the test references by opening them with \SpecialChar LyX
 or directly running lyx2lyx
 on them.
 This would not work, since lyx2lyx and \SpecialChar LyX
 produce slightly different files
 regarding insignificant whitespace and line breaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adding a new test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases tests for new features may be added to one of the existing
 test files, but sometimes this is not possible or not wanted.
 Then a new test file needs to be added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create the new file 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx/test/<test name>.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and run tex2lyx in roundtrip mode to produce the file 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx/test/<test name>.lyx.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This file will be the new reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Once you confirmed that the tex2lyx output is correct, add the new files
 to the corresponding lists in

Somebody is actively working on a fix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The bug is so severe that it would block the release if it is not fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a bug is important, but nobody is working on it, and it is no showstopper,
 use a milestone like 2.1.x or 2.2.x.
 For all other bugs, do not set a milestone at all.

\begin_layout Chapter
Documentation policies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main documentation consists of these files:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
splash.lyx it is the first file you see after an installation.
 We assume that a new user sees this.
 It is therefore designed to be as simple as possible.
 Therefore please don't add any new formatting, only fix typos etc.
 Splash.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Intro.lyx This is the manual new users will read to learn \SpecialChar LyX
.
 It therefore uses a limited set of formatting.
 For example a standard document class.
 Since new users will first learn about the formatting possibilities of
 \SpecialChar LyX
 please keep this file that simple.
 Intro.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Tutorial.lyx our tutorial.
 It must be always up to date.
 Normally there is nothing to add since we don't want to overwhelm new users
 with too much details.
 The will learn these details while using \SpecialChar LyX
 and we have special manuals.
 Tutorial.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
UserGuide.lyx our main user guide.
 It covers a mixture of basic and detailed information.
 Some information is also in the Math and EmbeddedObjects manual so that
 the UserGuide refers to these files.
 UserGuide.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
EmbeddedObjects.lyx a special manual to explain things like tables floats
 boxes etc.
 in all detail.
 EmbeddedObjects.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe
 Stöhr.

\begin_layout Description
Math.lyx a special manual to explain everything regarding math in all detail.
 Math.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Additional.lyx this manual covers information that would be too much detail
 for the UserGuide or would make the UserGuide uncompilable or only compilable
 when installing a lot of special \SpecialChar LaTeX
-packages.
 What should be in the UserGuide or better in Additional is a matter of
 taste.
 it is up to you to decide that.
 Additional.lyx is not completely up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x.
 Only chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

8 is up to date and currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
 It certainly needs a rewrite and update.
 For example many info in chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2 and 3 are already covered by the UserGuide and/or the EmbeddedObjects
 manual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Customization.lyx this manual covers information how to customize \SpecialChar LyX
 for certain
 output formats, operating systems, languages etc.
 It is currently completely out of date and needs a major rewrite and update.
 If you do this please assure that your information are given for all OSes
 and \SpecialChar LaTeX
 distributions (meaning be as objective as possible).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are only 4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

rules in editing the docs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you are not the maintainer of a doc file or a chapter/section, you MUST
 use change tracking so that the maintainer could review your changes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Respect the formatting of the document.
 The different files use different formatting styles.
 That is OK and has historic reasons nobody fully know ;-).
 But it is important to be consistent within one file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All changes you make to a file in one language MUST also go the file in
 the other actively maintained languages.
 Normally the maintainer does this for you, if you are the maintainer, you
 must do this by copying or changing the changed or added text to the other
 files so that the translators sees the blue underlined text and know what
 they have to translate and what was changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You MUST assure that the document is compilable as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PDF (pdflatex)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 after your changes.
\end_layout

\end_body
