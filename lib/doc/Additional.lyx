\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual is essentially Part II of the 
\emph on
User's Guide\SpecialChar endofsentence

\emph default
 The reason for separating the two documents is simple:
 the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 is already quite lengthy,
 and it contains information on all of the basic features one needs to know in order to prepare most documents.
 However,
 the \SpecialChar LyX
 Team has worked to make \SpecialChar LyX
 extensible through various configuration files and external packages.
 That means that if you want to support the Fizzwizzle \SpecialChar LaTeX
 package,
 you can create a layout file (or module) for it without having to alter \SpecialChar LyX
 itself.
 We've already had contributions of several new features this way,
 and some of them are documented here.
 There are also some more `advanced' features,
 such as how to control the presentation of bibliographies and how to work with multi-part documents,
 that are not covered in the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 and are discussed here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual also documents some special features,
 like fax support
\change_deleted 244031559 1603802929
,

\change_inserted 244031559 1603802931
 and
\change_unchanged
 version control
\change_deleted 244031559 1603802954
,
 and SGML support
\change_unchanged
,
 which require additional software to work properly.
 There is also a chapter on \SpecialChar LyX
's support for HTML.
 And lastly,
 there's a chapter of \SpecialChar LaTeX
 tools and tips,
 things you can use to spruce up your documents by directly using the powerful features of \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 After all,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 only WYSIWYM and will only ever interface to some,
 not all,
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you haven't read the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 yet,
 you are definitely in the wrong manual.
 The 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 is the first place to go,
 since it describes the notation and format of all of the manuals.
 You should also be thoroughly familiar with the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 and all of the basic features of \SpecialChar LyX
 before attempting to read this one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since many of the topics in this manual depend heavily on \SpecialChar LyX
's interaction with \SpecialChar LaTeX
,
 this first chapter covers the inner workings of \SpecialChar LyX
 and how to direct \SpecialChar LyX
 to generate exactly the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 code you want.
 It is obviously for more seasoned \SpecialChar LyX
 users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
\SpecialChar LyX
 and \SpecialChar LaTeX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How \SpecialChar LyX
 Uses \SpecialChar LaTeX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter is for both \SpecialChar TeX
-nicians and the \SpecialChar LaTeX
-curious.
 In it,
 we'll explain how \SpecialChar LyX
 and \SpecialChar LaTeX
 work together to produce printable output.
 This is the only place in any of the manuals where we assume you know something about \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At one time,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 was called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

WYSIWYM frontend to \SpecialChar LaTeX
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but that's no longer true.
 There are frontends to \SpecialChar LaTeX
 out there.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some familar ones are \SpecialChar TeX
maker and kile,
 on Linux,
 and \SpecialChar TeX
shop,
 OSX.
 There are also the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 modes for vi and emacs,
 of course.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 These are basically text editors with the ability to run \SpecialChar LaTeX
 and mark any errors in the file you're editing.
 Although \SpecialChar LyX
 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 an editor,
 and it 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 run \SpecialChar LaTeX
,
 and it also indicates errors in the file,
 it also does much,
 much more.
 For one thing,
 you don't need to know \SpecialChar LaTeX
 to use \SpecialChar LyX
 effectively.
 And \SpecialChar LyX
 has added its own extensions to \SpecialChar LaTeX
.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On that last point,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 does have quite a few features tucked into it,
 and more are coming.
 Be sure to check the manuals to make sure that \SpecialChar LyX
 doesn't have such-and-such feature before you decide you have to do it by hand.
 Moreover,
 there are numerous \SpecialChar LaTeX
 packages out there to do all sorts of things,
 from labels to envelopes to fancy multipage tables.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
\SpecialChar LyX
 and the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 Preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
About the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 Preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you already know \SpecialChar LaTeX
,
 there is no need to explain here what the preamble is good for.
 If you don't,
 the following will give you some ideas—
we recommend again that you consult a \SpecialChar LaTeX
 book for further information.
 In any case,
 you should read the points below,
 because they explain what you can do and what you don't need to do in the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 preamble of a \SpecialChar LyX
 document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The \SpecialChar LaTeX
 preamble comes at the very beginning of a document,
 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the text.
 It serves to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Declare the document class.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

\SpecialChar LyX
 already does this for you.
 If you're a seasoned \SpecialChar LaTeX
-nician,
 and you have a custom document class you want to use,
 check out the 
\emph on
Customization Manual
\emph default
 for information on how to make \SpecialChar LyX
 interface to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Declare the usage of packages.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

\SpecialChar LaTeX
 packages provide special commands,
 which are only available within a document when the package has been declared in the preamble.
 In addition to providing special commands,
 the inclusion of a package can change the document.
 For example,
 the package 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
indentfirst
\end_layout

\end_inset

 forces all paragraphs to be indented.
 There are other packages for labels,
 envelopes,
 margins,
 etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Set counters,
 variables,
 lengths and widths.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There are several \SpecialChar LaTeX
 counters and variables that 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 be set globally from within the preamble in order to have the desired effect.
 (There are variables that you can set and reset inside the document,
 too.) Margins are a good example of something that must be set in the preamble.
 Another example is the label format for lists.
 You can actually set these just about anywhere,
 but it's best to do it just once,
 inside the preamble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Declare user defined commands (with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
newcommand
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
renewcommand
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

These are abbreviations for \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands which appear very often inside a document.
 Although the preamble is a good place to declare such commands,
 they 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 be declared anywhere (before they are used for the first time,
 of course).
 This can be useful if there is a lot of raw \SpecialChar LaTeX
 code in your document,
 which normally should not be the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 adds its own set of definitions to the preamble of the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file it produces.
 This makes \SpecialChar LaTeX
 files generated by \SpecialChar LyX
 portable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Changing the Preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commands which \SpecialChar LyX
 adds to the preamble of a \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file are fixed;
 you can't change them without patching \SpecialChar LyX
 itself.
 You can,
 however,
 add your own stuff to the preamble by selecting 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\SpecialChar LaTeX

\begin_inset space ~

 \SpecialChar LyX
 adds anything in the 
\begin_inset Flex Noun

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 dialog to its own built-in preamble.
 Before adding your own declarations in the preamble,
 you should make sure that \SpecialChar LyX
 doesn't already support what you want to do.
 (Remember what we said about reinventing the wheel?) Also,
 
\emph on
make sure your preamble code is correct
\emph default
.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 doesn't check it for you.
 If there is an error,
 you're likely to get an error like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
begin{document}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd

 If you see this error,
 check your preamble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are some examples of what you can add to a preamble,
 and what they do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example #1:
 Offsets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two variables under \SpecialChar LaTeX
 that control page position:
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
hoffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
voffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Their names should be self-explanatory.
 These variables are useful if you think for a moment about computer labels.
 Sometimes,
 the size of a print medium and the area of the medium that you can actually print on aren't the same.
 This is where 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
hoffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
voffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 come in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default values for 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
hoffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
voffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 are both 0
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

points,
 i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

the page isn't shifted.
 Unfortunately,
 some DVI drivers always seem to shift the page.
 We have no idea why,
 or why the sysadmin hasn't fixed such behavior.
 If you're using \SpecialChar LyX
 on a system that you don't personally maintain,
 and your sysadmin is a doofus,
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
hoffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
voffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 can save the day.
 Suppose your left and top margins are always 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

inches too big.
 You can add this to the preamble:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
setlength{
\backslash
hoffset}{-0.5 in}
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
setlength{
\backslash
voffset}{-0.5 in}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and your margins should now be correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example #2:
 Labels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speaking of labels,
 suppose you wanted to print out a bunch of address labels.
 There's a rather nice package,
 available at your nearest CTAN archive,
 for printing sheets of labels:
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
labels.sty
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Now,
 your system may not have this package installed by default.
 We leave that up to you to check.
 You'll also want to read the documentation for it;
 we're not going to do that for you.
 Since this is an example,
 however,
 we'll give you an example of how you use this package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First,
 make sure you're using the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
article
\end_layout

\end_inset

 document class.
 Next,
 you need to put the following in your preamble:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
usepackage{labels}
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
LabelCols=3
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
LabelRows=7
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
LeftBorder=8mm
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
RightBorder=8mm
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
TopBorder=9mm
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
BottomBorder=2mm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sets things up for Avery label sheets,
 stock #5360.
 You're now ready to print labels,
 but you'll need to insert \SpecialChar LaTeX
 code,
 placing the commands 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
begin{labels}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
end{labels}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 around each label text.
 This and other special features of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
labels.sty
\end_layout

\end_inset

 are explained in its documentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Someday,
 someone may write a \SpecialChar LyX
 layout file to support this package directly.
 Maybe that someone is you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example #3:
 Paragraph Indentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Americans are trained to indent the first line of 
\emph on
every
\emph default
 paragraph.
 As with all of their other weird quirks,
 most Americans will whine and moan until they can have their way and indent the first line of all paragraphs.
 (Yes,
 we're joking.
 (We are?) 
\emph on
Yeah
\emph default
,
 we are.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course,
 this behavior isn't standard typography.
 In books,
 you typically only indent the first line of a paragraph 
\emph on
if
\emph default
 it follows another one.
 The idea behind indenting the first line of a paragraph is to distinguish neighboring paragraphs from one another.
 If there is no previous paragraph—
for example,
 if it follows a figure or is the first paragraph in a section—
then there is no need for indentation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're a typical American (we're still joking!),
 though,
 you don't care about such esoteric things;
 you want your indentation!
 Add this to the preamble:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
usepackage{indentfirst}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your \SpecialChar TeX
 distribution isn't braindead,
 you'll have this package,
 and all of your paragraphs will get the indentation the Founding Fathers intended they should have.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example #4:
 This Document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also check out the preamble of this document to get an idea of some of the advanced things you can do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
\SpecialChar LyX
 and \SpecialChar LaTeX
 Errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When \SpecialChar LyX
 calls \SpecialChar LaTeX
,
 it tells \SpecialChar LaTeX
 to blithely ignore any errors and keep going.
 It then uses the logfile from the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 run to do a post-mortem.
 After analyzing the logfile,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 displays a dialog listing the errors.
 Clicking on any one of them will take you to the position in your \SpecialChar LyX
 file where the error occurred.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Well,
 usually.
 Analyzing the logfile is a tough job,
 and \SpecialChar LyX
 doesn't always go to the right line.
 There are also cases where \SpecialChar LaTeX
 reports the error on one line,
 but the actual error is earlier.
 This is not unlike forgetting a closing brace in a program:
 You'll get an error,
 but only later.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some folks also like to look at the log file directly:

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

\SpecialChar LaTeX
 absolutely 
\emph on
loves
\emph default
 to spew these out.
 It seems to generate at least one of these messages for just about any document you write.
 They are warnings about lines that were too long and run past the right margin.
 This happens if \SpecialChar LaTeX
 does not find a reasonable way to break the lines (notoriously often with typewriter font,
 since this does not allow for automatic break points).
 In many cases,
 this is unnoticeable in the final output.
 (It can be just a point or two.) Sometimes,
 however,
 the lines run rather visibly into the margin;
 something you will not want to have in your final print.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

There are several global ways to try to minimize the overfull lines.
 Clicking 
\family sans

 might already improve things a lot.
 Furthermore,
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 code such as the following in 
\family sans

\family default
 usually reduces the overfull lines drastically (we use this in the preamble of this document):

There are other error and warning messages.

 Did you try to kludge something together with these instead of using the appropriate paragraph environment?

\begin_layout Enumerate
All right,
 you didn't use any of the fine-tuning options,
 you played by the rules.
 Did you try to pull a fancy maneuver?
 Did you do something funky inside a table or an equation,
 like inserting a graphic into a table cell?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do you have long sections of text where \SpecialChar LaTeX
 cannot find a place to break a line?
 By default,
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is rather strict about how much extra inter-word spacing it will add in order to break a line.
 Preferably,
 you should rework the paragraph to avoid the problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Did you go overboard with the nesting?
 \SpecialChar LyX
 (currently) doesn't check to make sure you're in the limits for nesting environments.
 If you nested a bunch of environments to the 
\begin_inset Formula $17^{\mathrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 level,
 that's the problem.
 (The limit in \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is five.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Okay,
 you didn't get any error messages,
 but your output looks awful.
 If you have a table or figure that's too wide or long for the page,
 you need to:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
rescale the figure so it fits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
trim down the table so it fits.

 we're not sure what's wrong.

\begin_layout Theorem
This is typically used for the statements of major results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary*
This is used for statements which follow fairly directly from previous statements.
 Again,
 these can be major results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
These are smaller results needed to prove other statements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
These are less major results which (hopefully) add to the general theory being discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Conjecture
These are statements provided without justification,
 which the author does not know how to prove,
 but which seem to be true (to the author,
 at least).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition*
Guess what this is for.
 The font is different for this environment than for the previous ones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example*
Used for examples illustrating proven results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
It's not really known what this is for.
 You should figure it out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Exercise*
Write a description for this one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
This environment is also a type of theorem,
 usually a lesser sort of observation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Claim*
Often used in the course of giving a proof of a larger result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Case
Generally,
 these are used to break up long arguments,
 using specific instances of some condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Case
The numbering scheme for cases is on its own,
 not together with other numbered statements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
At the end of this environment,
 a QED symbol (usually a square,
 but it can vary with different styles) is placed.
 If you want to have other environments within this one—
for example,
 Case environments—
and have the QED symbol appear only after them,
 then the other environments need to be nested within the proof environment.

The KOMA-Script collection of document classes is a development of the Script classes created by Frank Neukam in the early 1990s;
 it was formally launched with the addition of a letter class in 1994.
 Since then,
 a second letter class has been added.
 Frank Neukam's classes were inspired by the principles of typography and this has been fully integrated into the design of the KOMA-Script classes.

The layout of a KOMA-Script page follows one of two traditional typesetting conventions based on dividing the page into strips or drawing a circle.
 The default is to imagine that a page is divided horizontally and vertically into strips and allocate strips to the margins leaving the unused strips for the text area.
 You can change the sizes of the margins by changing the factor by which the page is divided into strips;
 the default for an A4 page is 9 and increasing this factor will produce increasingly narrower strips and therefore narrower margins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 564990737 1672429310
Whatever the factor,
 two strips are allocated to the outer and bottom margins of a two-sided document and one strip to the inner and top margins,
 leaving a text area occupying around half the page.
 Since most two-sided documents have a binding,
 this can make the inner margins appear too narrow;
 so you can apply a binding correction to the page which is deducted before the size of the strips is calculated.

It could be seen as a matter of inconsequence,
 that the types 
\family sans
Letter
\family default
 and 
\family sans

\family default
 described above are not such input types as well.
 Because of the special meaning of those types,
 however,
 I have implemented them as ordinary paragraph types with a one letter mark in the left margin.
 Moreover,
 it would affect my feeling of symmetry,
 if the 
\family sans
Opening
\family default

\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted 564990737 1672429749
An implementation of these types in a WYSIWYG fashion does not seem to make sense,
 because the real appearance of the produced letter does not only depend on the usage of the particular type,
 but also on other factors.
 For example,
 a signature entered in the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 type will in the standard behavior appear in the produced letter only,
 when in the same letter also a 
\family sans
Closing
\family default
 type is used.
 The entered value of the 
\family sans

\family default
 type will in the standard behavior not appear in the produced letter at all.
 The possibility to design the letter`s heading freely is already indicated in a footnote above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted 564990737 1672429749
The input types can also be used as empty paragraphs.

\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}

for the 
\family sans

\family default
 type.
 If the 
\family sans

\family default
 type is not used at all,
 in the standard behavior the value of the 
\family sans

\family default
 type is used as signature,
 whereas if an empty

 no signature value is defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted 564990737 1672429749

\noindent
Koma-Script version 2.8 has introduced a new letter class 
\family typewriter
scrlttr2
\family default
 which supersedes the now unsupported 
\family typewriter
scrlettr
\family default
.
 It has —
 on the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 side —
 a completely new interface and is not compatible with the old class.
 Therefore,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 supports both,
 though it is recommended you use the new class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class covers the same functionality as 
\emph on
letter (koma-script),

\emph default
 and a few more.
 The basic items are 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 (receiver's address,
 same as 
\family sans
Letter
\family default
 in the old layout),
 
\family sans
Opening
\family default
,
 and 
\family sans
Closing
\family default
.
 
\family sans
NextAddress
\family default
 will start a new letter (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

you can write several letters per document).
 New elements are sender's 
\family sans
E-Mail
\family default
,
 
\family sans
URL
\family default
,
 
\family sans
Fax
\family default
,
 
\family sans
Bank
\family default
 and the possibility to use a 
\family sans
Logo
\family default
 (via 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar menuseparator
Graphics
\family default
) in the header.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The biggest improvement is,
 though,
 that the letter's layout is configurable to meet almost any needs.
 This can be done via the preamble or with a special style file (Letter Class Option,
 extension 
\family typewriter
*.lco
\family default
),
 that will be read in as a class option.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The KOMA package comes with some default 
\family typewriter
*.lco
\family default
 files.
 There is,
 for instance,
 a 
\family typewriter
DIN.lco
\family default
 file that follows german typesetting rules,
 or a 
\family typewriter
KOMAold.lco
\family default
 that provides the default layout of the old 
\family typewriter
scrlettr
\family default
 class.
 The latter can be loaded with the class option 
\family typewriter

Problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Visualizing the Koma-Script document classes in \SpecialChar LyX
,
 the \SpecialChar LyX
 internals cause some problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The chapter number of a 
\family sans
Chapter
\family default
 type appears on a line of its own above the chapter heading instead of appearing in the same line ahead of it.
 The cause for that is the \SpecialChar LyX
 internal behavior for the labeltype 
\family sans
Counter_Chapter
\family default
 in the layout file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The headings of the types 
\family sans
Addchap
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Addsec
\family default
 are only put in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 table of contents,
 but not in the \SpecialChar LyX
 table of contents (
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

of
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Contents
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The paragraphs in a 
\emph on
letter
\emph default
 document class appear in a skip separation mode,
 not indented.
 This is the standard behavior,
 no special \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands are needed for that.
 But in the 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings
\family default
 dialog the corresponding radio button indicates 
\family sans
Indent
\family default
.
 A 
\family sans
Skip
\family default
 value always has the effect that extra \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands are inserted in the document to produce the gap,
 which is not what is wanted in this case.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 is a set of macros produced by the American Astronomical Society to facilitate electronic manuscript submission to the three journals they publish:
 the Astrophysical Journal (including the Letters and Supplement),
 the Astronomical Journal,
 and the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 has proven to be an excellent tool for generating these documents,
 especially given its equation,
 citation,
 and figure handling capabilities.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 requires version 5.0 (or higher) of these macros;
 preferably 6.0,
 which is the version described here,
 or higher.
 Versions prior to 5.0 are intended for use with \SpecialChar LaTeX
2.09 and are fundamentally incompatible with \SpecialChar LyX
.
 The AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 package may be downloaded from the AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 Web site

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A complete user guide is contained in that package and you should familiarize yourself with it thoroughly before embarking on writing a paper in \SpecialChar LyX
.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will not reduce the need to figure out all the AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 commands,
 it will only reduce the drudgery of typing everything in.
 It is your responsibility to ensure that the final exported \SpecialChar LaTeX
 document conforms completely to the requirements of the journal to which you are submitting your paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Starting a New Paper

 template file.

\family default
,
 enter the new file name,
 then choose the 
\family typewriter
aastex6.lyx
\family default
 template
\change_unchanged
.
 This will show the most common fields found in a manuscript.
 Simply overwrite the existing text (including the brackets,
 
\family typewriter
<>
\family default
) with the correct information.
 Many of the AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 commands and environments can be implemented directly in \SpecialChar LyX
,
 but some cannot.
 For commands such as these,
 the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 code must be entered directly and marked as such.
 Such commands are referred to as \SpecialChar TeX
 code,
 or Evil Red Text.
 I tried to minimize the amount of \SpecialChar TeX
 code needed in an AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 document.

I will not describe the detailed usage of the individual AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 commands:
 the AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 User Guide (

 Thus it's probably easiest for me to go down the list as found in the guide and offer comments where necessary.

Getting \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be a bit tricky to get \SpecialChar LyX
 to recognize a new layout and document class.
 When all else fails,
 do this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make certain that \SpecialChar LaTeX
 can find AAS\SpecialChar TeX

 Copy sample.tex (and perhaps table.tex) from the AAS\SpecialChar TeX

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX

\begin_layout Enumerate
Entering the references at all is not obvious.
 The easiest thing is to start typing your first reference at the end of the document,
 then mark it as type 
\family sans
References
\family default
.
 That will put a small gray box in front of what you just typed.
 Click on the box to fill in the rest of the information.
 For new references,
 go to the end of an existing reference and press return.
 That will create a new line with its own box,
 etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Including EPS files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 provides its own figure commands (
\family typewriter

\backslash
plotone
\family default
,
 for example),
 I much prefer \SpecialChar LaTeX
's standard figure commands (with the default graphicx).
 You can insert the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
plotone
\family default
,
 etc.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

commands as \SpecialChar TeX
 code into a Figure Float box if you desire,
 but I never have much luck getting the layout right.
 With the standard graphics,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will insert a 
\family typewriter

\backslash
usepackage{graphicx}
\family default
 command into the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 preamble and handle the figures in the standard \SpecialChar LaTeX2e
 way,
 interspersing the figures in the text.
 I believe ApJ accepts figures exactly this way now;
 AJ might still use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stack everything at the end
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Things I could have done,
 but didn't
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pretty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 things I could have implemented,
 but chose not to.
 For instance,
 I saw no point in double-spacing the text in the \SpecialChar LyX
 window,
 even though it is double-spaced in the paper manuscript.
 Also,
 I chose not to make separate layouts for the preprint and preprint2 styles.
 Since I assume you will spend most of your time in the plain manuscript mode anyway,
 I decided not to chew up more disk space with this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Final Caveat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your mileage may vary.
 I've now had papers published by both ApJ and AJ that have had 98% of the effort done in \SpecialChar LyX
;
 the last 2% was the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 post-processing and a few cleanups.
 I have had no trouble with the submission process,
 and I'm sure the journals were never aware that there might be a difference.
 So,
 go forth and publish!

\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Install it somewhere that \SpecialChar LaTeX
 can see it.
 Test it by trying to \SpecialChar LaTeX
 a short Rev\SpecialChar TeX
 4 document in some random directory (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

not the directory where you installed the class file.) Then,
 if you reconfigure \SpecialChar LyX
,
 it will find the class file and let you use the Rev\SpecialChar TeX
4 textclass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probably the easiest way to get started is either to import a Rev\SpecialChar TeX

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Memoir is a very powerful and constantly evolving class.
 It has been designed with regard to fictional and non-fictional literature.
 Its aim is to let the user have maximum control over the typesetting of his document.
 Memoir is based on the standard book class,
 but it can also emulate the article class (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peter Wilson,
 the developer of Memoir,
 is known as the author of lots of useful packages in the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 world.
 Most of them have been merged with Memoir.
 Therefore,
 it is much easier to layout the table of contents,
 appendices,
 chapter designs and such.
 \SpecialChar LyX
,
 though,
 does not support all of these goodies natively.
 Some of them might be added to forthcoming releases

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 lots will probably never be supported,
 due to the limitations of \SpecialChar LyX
's framework.
 Of course you can still use all features with the help of some native \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands (\SpecialChar TeX

\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 In this section,
 we can only list those features that are natively supported by \SpecialChar LyX
.
 For detailed descriptions (and for the rest of features) we recommend you have a look at the detailed manual of the Memoir class

,
 which is not only a user guide for the class,
 but also both a comprehensive description on good typesetting and a superb example for good typesetting itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Basic features and restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Memoir supports basically all features of the standard book classes.
 There are,
 however,
 some differences,
 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Font
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

sizes:
 Memoir has a broader range of font sizes:
 9,
 10,
 11,
 12,
 14,
 17
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Page
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

style:
 The fancy page style is not supported,
 due to a command clash between Memoir and the fancyhdr package (they both define a command with the same name,
 which confuses \SpecialChar LaTeX
).
 Instead,
 Memoir comes with a number of its own page styles (see 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings\SpecialChar menuseparator
Page
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Style
\family default
).
 If you want to use these for the chapter pages,
 you have to use the command 
\family typewriter

\backslash
chapterstyle
\family default
 in the main text or in preamble (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
chapterstyle{companion}
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Sectioning:
 Sectionings (chapter,
 section,
 subsection etc.) come with an optional argument in the standard classes.
 With this,
 you can specify an alternative version of the title for the table of contents and the headers (for instance,
 if the title is too long).
 In \SpecialChar LyX
,
 you can do this via 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar menuseparator
Short
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Title
\family default
 at the beginning of a chapter/section.
 Memoir features a second optional argument and thus separates the table of contents from the header.
 You can define three variants of a title with this:
 one for the main text,
 one for the table of contents,
 and one for the headers.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 makes these available in form of specific 
\family sans
Short Title
\family default
 variants in the 
\family sans
Insert
\family default
 menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
TOC/LOT/LOF:
 In the standard classes (and in many other classes),
 the table of contents,
 the list of figures and the list of table start a new page automatically.
 Memoir does not follow this route.
 You have to insert a page break yourself,
 if you want to have one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Titlepage:
 For some unknown reason,
 Memoir uses pagination on the title page (in the standard classes,
 title pages are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

empty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 If you want an empty title page,
 type 
\family typewriter

\backslash
aliaspagestyle{title}{empty}
\family default
 in the preamble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Article:
 With the class option 
\emph on
article
\emph default
 (to be inserted in 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings\SpecialChar menuseparator
Class Settings\SpecialChar menuseparator
Custom
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Options
\family default
),
 you can emulate article style.
 That is,
 counters (footnotes,
 figures,
 tables etc.) will not be reset on new chapters,
 chapters don't start a new page (but are—
in contrary to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 article classes—
still allowed),
 parts,
 though,
 use their own page,
 as in book.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Oldfontcommands:
 By default,
 Memoir does not allow the use of the deprecated font commands,
 which have been used in the old \SpecialChar LaTeX
 version 2.09 (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
rm
\family default
,
 
\family typewriter

\backslash
it
\family default
).
 It produces an error and stops \SpecialChar LaTeX
 whenever such a command appears.
 The class option 
\emph on
oldfontcommands
\emph default
 reallows the commands and spits out warnings instead (which does at least not stop \SpecialChar LaTeX
).
 Since a lot of packages and particularly Bib\SpecialChar TeX
 style files are still using those commands,
 we have decided to use this option by default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Extra features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will only describe the features supported by \SpecialChar LyX
 (which is not much currently).
 Please consult the Memoir manual

 for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Abstract:
 You may wonder why an abstract is an extra feature.
 Well,
 it is in book class.
 Usually books don't have abstracts.
 Memoir,
 however,
 has.
 You can use it wherever and how often you like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Chapterprecis:
 You may know this older typesetting style:
 The contents of a chapter are summarized below the title and also in the table of contents (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\emph on
Our hero arrives in Troia;
 he loses some friends;
 he finds others
\emph default
).
 Chapterprecis does exactly this.
 It is therefore only sensible below a chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Epigraph:
 An epigraph is a smart slogan or motto at the beginning of a chapter.
 The epigraph environment provides an elegant way of typesetting such a motto.
 The motto itself (text) and its (optional) author (source) are divided by a short line.
 The author (source) can be inserted via 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar menuseparator
Epigraph Source
\family default
\emph on
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Poemtitle:
 Memoir has lots of possibilities to typeset poetry (up to very complex figurative poems).
 \SpecialChar LyX
 can only support a few of them.
 One is poemtitle,
 which is a centered title for poems,
 which will also be added to the table of contents (verse is the standard environment for poems.
 Memoir has some enhanced versions of verse,
 but you need to use \SpecialChar TeX
 code,
 because they have to be nested inside regular verse environments,
 which is not possible with \SpecialChar LyX
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Poemtitle*:
 Same as poemtitle,
 but it adds no entry to the table of contents.

Getting Started
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously,
 to use this document class,
 you need to select 
\family sans

\family default
 from the 
\family sans
Class
\family default
 entry in the 
\family sans
Document
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Layout
\family default
 dialog.
 There are some settings in the 
\family sans
Document
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Layout
\family default
 dialog that you should know about that are specific to this class:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Don't change the options 
\family sans
Sides
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Columns
\family default
 on the 
\family sans

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Layout
\family default
 dialog.
 They're ignored by the 
\family sans
foils
\family default
 class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The default font size is 20
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

pt with the other options being 17
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

pt,
 25
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

pt and 30
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

pt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The default font is 
\family sans
sans
\family default
 
\family sans
serif
\family default
 but all math equations are still typeset in the usual roman font.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Foil\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 supports A4 and Letter paper sizes as well as a special size for working with 35
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

mm slides.
 It doesn't support A5,
 B5,
 legal or executive paper sizes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Don't bother changing the 
\family sans
Float Placement
\family default
 settings because they are ignored anyway.
 All floats appear where they are defined in the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family sans
Pagestyle
\family default
 setting behaves a bit differently for this class.
 
\family sans
Foil\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 provides extensive footer and header capabilities including a user-defined logo.
 See section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:foilfoot"

\end_inset

 for more details.
 The title page is treated differently to all other pages in the document and is 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 unnumbered and 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 has the logo centered at the bottom of the page (if one is defined).
 The possible page style choices and what they do are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMM

\family sans
\series bold
empty
\family default
\series default
 The final output contains no page numbers,
 or other headers or footers (except footnotes of course).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMM

\family sans
\series bold
plain
\family default
\series default
 The final output contains page numbers centered at the bottom of the page.
 No other headings or footers (other than footnotes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMM

\series bold
foilheadings
\series default
 Page numbers in lower right corner.
 Additional headers and footers are also shown.
 This is also the default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMM

\series bold
fancy
\series default
 Gives you access to the 
\family sans
fancyheadings
\family default
 package although its use with 
\family sans
Foil\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 is discouraged by the writer of the 
\family sans
Foil\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 package because of some potential page layout clashes.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Paragraph
Extra Options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following options may be used in the extra class options in the 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings
\family default
 dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

\series bold
35mmSlide
\series default
 This sets up the page layout for 7.33
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

in by 11
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

in paper,
 which is about the same aspect ratio as a 35
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

mm slide,
 making it a bit easier to work with this medium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

\series bold
headrule
\series default
 Places a rule across the page below the header on every page except the title page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

\series bold
footrule
\series default
 Places a rule across the page above the footer on every page except the title page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

\series bold
dvips
\series default
 This is automatically set each time you create a new 
\family sans
foils
\family default
 document.
 This option tells 
\family sans
Foil\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 to use the dvips driver to rotate those pages that are set as landscape foils.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

\series bold
landscape
\series default
 Simply changes the page dimensions to those of a landscape page but doesn't do any rotation.
 Thus if you use this option you need to use an external program to rotate each page or feed your paper through your printer as landscape.
 Note that this option effectively reverses the roles of the 
\family sans
Foilhead
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Rotatefoilhead
\family default
 environments (don't worry these are described in the next section).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling

leqno
\series default
 Equation numbers on the left.

Building a Set of Foils
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section will give a simple introduction to using the different environments to build a set of foils.
 If you want to see an example set of foils,
 take a look at 
\change_deleted 564990737 1671643085
the 
\family typewriter
Foils.lyx

 creates the title on a page of its own.
 If you leave out the 
\family sans
Date
\family default
 environment \SpecialChar LaTeX
 will substitute the current date (every time you regenerate the output).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Start a New Foil
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I mentioned earlier,
 there are four ways of starting a new foil.
 For portrait foils you should use 
\family sans
Foilhead
\family default
 or 
\family sans
ShortFoilhead.

\family default
 The difference between these two environments is the amount of space between the title of the foil (the foilhead) and the body of the foil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Landscape foils are generated using the 
\family sans
Rotatefoilhead
\family default
 and 
\family sans
ShortRotatefoilhead
\family default
 environments.
 Again the only difference is the spacing between foilhead and body.
 Both of the short versions have 0.5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

inches less separation between the foilhead and the body.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One problem with the support for landscape foils is the requirement that you have to use the 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
 driver to generate the PostScript output otherwise the foils won't be rotated.
 It is possible to get landscape foils even if you haven't got the 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
 driver provided you can feed your foils sideways through your printer ;-)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Theorems,
 Lemmas,
 Proofs and more
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can't have two of the same type of these environments directly following each other.
 If you use a normal paragraph break,
 ,
 you will just be extending the previous environment as if you had merged the two environments together.
 Rather than that,
 you need to insert a so-called separator.
 Please refer to the section entitled 
\emph on
Separate Nestings
\emph default
 in the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Lists
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You get all the commonly supported list styles found in other classes as well as two new ones.
 I'll only describe the new ones here.
 If you want to find out more about the other list environments check out the 
\emph on
User's Guide.

\emph default
 If you intend to use itemized lists you might also want to read about the 
\family sans

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two new list styles,
 
\family sans
TickList
\family default
 and 
\family sans
CrossList
\family default
,
 are designed to make it easier for you to create lists of do's and don'ts or right and wrong by providing dedicated environments that use a tick or a cross as the label of the list.
 These lists are in fact dedicated variants of the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment.
 They do however require that you have the 
\family typewriter
psnfss
\family default
 packages installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Figures and Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family sans
Foil\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 redefines the floating tables and figures so that they appear exactly where they are in the text rather than pushing them to the top of the page or to some user specified location.
 In fact if you change the float placement settings they are simply ignored.

 The first is meant to allow you to include a graphic logo on your foils and defaults to

\family default
 within another environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Lengths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All lengths are adjusted using the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
setlength{
\family default
\emph on
lengthname
\family typewriter
\emph default
}{
\family default
\emph on
newlength
\family typewriter
\emph default
}
\family default
 command.
 Where 
\emph on
lengthname
\emph default
 should be replaced by the name given to the length you want to change and 
\emph on
newlength
\emph default
 is the length value.
 All lengths should be specified in units of length such as inches (
\family typewriter
in
\family default
),
 millimeters (
\family typewriter
mm
\family default
) or points (
\family typewriter
pt
\family default
) or relative to some document or font-based length such as 
\family typewriter

\backslash
textwidth
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's possible to change the spacing between a foilhead and the body of the foil by adjusting the length specified by 
\family typewriter

\backslash
foilheadskip
\family default
.
 For example,
 to make 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 foilheads 0.5
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

in closer to their bodies put the following in the preamble:
 
\family typewriter

\backslash
setlength{
\backslash
foilheadskip}{-0.5in}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spacings around floats can be adjusted by setting these lengths:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM

\family typewriter

\backslash
abovefloatskip
\family default
 Separation between the text and the top of the float
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM

\family typewriter

\backslash
abovecaptionskip
\family default
 Separation between the float and the caption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM

\family typewriter

\backslash
belowcaptionskip
\family default
 Separation between the caption and the following text
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM

\family typewriter

\backslash
captionwidth
\family default
 You can make the captions narrower than the surrounding text by adjusting this length.
 Best done relative to 
\family typewriter

\backslash
textwidth
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also several title page related lengths that you may find useful if you have a long title or several authors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM

\family typewriter

\backslash
abovetitleskip
\family default
 Separation from headers to 
\family sans
Title
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM

\family typewriter

\backslash
titleauthorskip
\family default
 between 
\family sans

\family default
 and 
\family sans

\family default
 environments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM

\family typewriter

\backslash
authorauthorskip
\family default
 between multiple 
\family sans
Author
\family default
 lines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM

\family typewriter

\backslash
authordateskip
\family default
 between the 
\family sans
Author
\family default
 and the 
\family sans
Date
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM

\family typewriter

\backslash
dateabstractskip
\family default
 between the 
\family sans

\family default
 and the 
\family sans
Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last length related command affects all the list environments.
 If you place 
\family typewriter

\backslash
zerolistvertdimens
\family default
 
\emph on
inside
\emph default
 a list environment then all the vertical spacing between the list items is removed.
 Note that this is a command not a length so it doesn't require 
\family typewriter

\backslash
setlength
\family default
 like the stuff mentioned above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Headers and Footers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter

\backslash
LogoOn
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\backslash
LogoOff
\family default
 commands control whether the logo in the 
\family sans
MyLogo
\family default
 definition appear on a given page.
 If you put 
\family typewriter

\backslash
LogoOff
\family default
 in the preamble then none of the foils will have the logo on them.
 If you don't want the logo on a particular page place the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
LogoOff
\family default
 directly after the foilhead of that page and the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
LogoOn
\family default
 directly after the next foilhead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you decide to use the 
\family sans
fancy
\family default
 page style setting in the 
\family sans
Document
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Layout
\family default
 dialog you should probably add 
\family typewriter

\backslash
let

 to your preamble so headers and footers on landscape pages are correctly placed when rotated.
 This is due to some clashes between the page layouts provided by the

These five are kind of quirky,
 due to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in \SpecialChar LyX
.
 You see,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 doesn't permit you to nest any other paragraph environment into an empty environment.
 Now,
 that's fine and dandy,
 but it means that you wouldn't be able to start a slide with anything except plain text.
 To deal with this,
 I've performed a little 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\SpecialChar LaTeX
 magic.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Quirks of the New Environments

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All five of the new paragraph environments are somewhat quirky due to inherent limitiations in the current version of \SpecialChar LyX
.
 As I just mentioned,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 forbids environments that begin with another environment.
 To get around this,
 the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 environment isn't a paragraph environment as described in the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should consider 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
,
 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
,
 and 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pseudo-environments.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 They look like a section heading or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
Caption
\family default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but really begin a [and,
 if necessary,
 end the previous] paragraph environment.
 Likewise,
 treat 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pseudo-commands.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 These two perform some action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common feature of all five environments,
 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
,
 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
,
 
\family sans
Note
\family default
,
 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
,
 is a rather long-ish label.
 The text following this label —
 ordinarily the contents of the paragraph environment —
 is utterly irrelevant for 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
,
 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
,
 
\family sans
Note
\family default
,
 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 completely ignores it.
 In fact,
 you can leave these five environments completely empty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While you don't 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 to put any text after the rather long-ish label,
 you might want to.
 This could be a short description of the contents of the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
,
 for example.
 In that case,
 enter your descriptive comment and hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 as you normally would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted -712698321 1673258321
If,
 on the other hand,
 you don't want to enter any descriptive text,
 you'll hit another \SpecialChar LyX
 quirk.
 \SpecialChar LyX
,
 like nature,
 abhors a vacuum,
 and will not let you start a new paragraph environment until you put something in the old one.
 So,
 do this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_deleted -712698321 1673258321
Start entering the text that will 
\emph on
follow
\emph default
 the new 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
,
 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
,
 
\family sans
Note
\family default
,
 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 or 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_deleted -712698321 1673258321
Now move to the beginning of that paragraph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_deleted -712698321 1673258321
Next,
 hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_deleted -712698321 1673258321
Finally,
 change this new,

 followed by the label,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

NewSlide:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Any text or paragraph environments that follow this one go on the new slide.
 It's that simple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slides are probably the only time you'll need to forcibly end pages in \SpecialChar LyX
 (this can be specified in the 
\family sans
Paragraph Layout
\family default
 dialog).
 In fact,
 you'll want to,
 once you finish entering the contents of one slide.
 If you've entered more text than can physically fit on a slide,
 the extra overflows onto a new slide.
 I don't recommend doing this,
 however,
 since the overflow slide won't have any page number on it.
 Furthermore,
 it may interfere with any 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 you've made to accompany the oversized 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 environments work the same way as the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 environment.
 They both create an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ASCII line
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 followed by a label [
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

NewOverlay:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

NewNote:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 respectively].
 The color is a stunning magenta instead of blue,
 and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ASCII line
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will look different,
 in style and in length.
 The label fonts of all three also differ from one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
,
 if the contents of a 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 exceed the physical size of a slide or sheet of paper,
 the extra will overflow onto a new sheet.
 Again,
 you should avoid this.
 It defeats the whole purpose of 
\family sans
Note
\family default
s and 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Using 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 with 
\family sans
Slide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea behind an 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 is a slide that sits atop another slide.
 Perhaps you wish to discuss a figure on the main 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 before displaying the text associated with it.
 One way to accomplish this is tape a flap of dark paper over the part of the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 you want to display later.
 This method fails,
 however,
 if you wish to overlap one graph with another,
 for example.
 You would then have to fumble while speaking to align the two separate,
 overlapping 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
s to align the two graphs.
 The use of an 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 environment in both cases makes life much easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each 
\family sans

\family default

\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
 Indeed,
 the \SpecialChar LyX
 
\family sans
slides
\family default
 class provides a visual cue for this:
 the label at the start of an 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 is shorter than that at the start of a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
 Lastly,
 when you generate printable output,
 you'll find alignment markers in all four corners of both the 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 page and its parent 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
 These will assist you in lining up the two physical slides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major problem in overlaying two slides is aligning the contents of the two transparencies.
 How much space should you leave for that graph on the second slide?
 Worse still,
 what if you want a graph and a sentence on second slide,
 but there is text on the main transparency that goes in between them?
 You could try and insert vertical space of the right size.
 The better way is to use 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As their names imply,
 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 are two command-like paragraph environments that make all subsequent text invisible and visible,
 respectively.
 Note from section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:slideQuirk"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 that you don't place anything 
\emph on
into
\emph default
 these two environments,
 however.
 When you create an 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
,
 it inserts a centered,
 sky-blue label into the page reading 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<Invisible Text Follows>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For paragraphs following this label,
 the parts of the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 [or 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
;
 it doesn't matter which] where they would be contain instead blank space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
,
 the corresponding centered label is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<Visible Text Follows>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in blazing green.
 Paragraphs following this label behave normally.
 Note that the beginning of a new 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
,
 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
,
 or 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 automatically shuts off an 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
.
 It's therefore not necessary to use 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 at the end of a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By now,
 it should be obvious how to create overlay transparencies using the proper combination of 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 on a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
,
 including everything that will appear on it,
 whether on the main slide or on the 
\family sans

\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Before each figure or paragraph that will appear only on the 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
,
 insert an 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 environment.
 If necessary,
 insert a 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 environment after the 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
-only text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Start an 
\family sans

\family default
 immediately following the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Copy the contents of this 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 into the 
\family sans

\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Within the 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
,
 change all of the 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 lines to 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 and vice-versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's it.
 You've just made an 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's one problem with the way I've designed the \SpecialChar LyX
 
\family sans
slides
\family default
 class:
 you can't make text in the middle of a paragraph invisible,
 nor make text in the middle of an invisible paragraph visible again.
 To accomplish this feat,
 you'll need to use some inlined \SpecialChar LaTeX
 codes.

\family default

 Here,
 too,
 the \SpecialChar LyX

 class provides visual cues.
 The label for a 
\family sans

\family default
 is shorter than that of a

 You can have multiple

 and,
 as with 
\family sans

\family default

\family default

 you'll probably want to break up long 
\family sans

\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of a 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 is obvious:
 it contains anything additional you might want to say about a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
 It could also be used as a sheet of reminders for a particular 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
 In the case of the latter,
 you might want to make use of time markers.
 Currently,
 the \SpecialChar LyX
 
\family sans
slides
\family default
 class has no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

native
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 support for time markers,
 a 
\noun on
Sli\SpecialChar TeX

\noun default
 feature.
 So,
 you'll have to resort to using the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 codes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use time markers,
 you'll need to specify the extra class option 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
clock
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 [see section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:slidesetup"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

].
 This option turns on timing marks,
 which will appear in the lower-left-hand corner of every 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 you generate.
 To set what appears in the time marker,
 you use the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
settime{}
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
addtime{}
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The arguments of both commands are time measured in seconds.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
settime{}
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sets the time marker to a given time.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
addtime{}
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 increments the time marker by the specified amount.
 Using time markers and 
\family sans
Note
\family default
s in this fashion,
 you can remind yourself how much time to spend on a particular 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's one last feature to describe.
 Clearly,
 you'd like to print out all of your 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
s and 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
s on transparencies while printing all of your 
\family sans
Note
\family default
s on plain paper.
 However,
 a 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 follow the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 with which it is associated.
 What's a person to do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luckily,
 there are two \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands that allow you to select what to print out.
 Both must be placed into the preamble of your document.
 The command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
onlyslides{
\backslash
slides}
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will cause the output to contain only the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
s and 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
s.
 Correspondingly,
 the command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
onlynotes{
\backslash
notes}
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 prevents the output of anything but 
\family sans
Note
\family default
s.
 I'd advise placing both commands in the preamble and initially comment both out.
 You can then preview your entire presentation as you write.
 When you're done writing,
 you can then uncomment one of the two to select what you want to print.
 I like to uncomment 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
onlyslides{
\backslash

\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ,
 print to a file with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

 in its name,
 comment it back out,
 then uncomment 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 and print to a

\end_inset

 I can then send either file to a printer,

This module provides two new paragraph styles:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\change_inserted 564990737 1671884699

\family sans
In Preamble
\family default
 which puts whatever is entered into it into the preamble.
 This can be used,
 if one wishes,
 to include preamble code in the body of a LyX document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\change_inserted 564990737 1671884699

\family sans
In Title
\family default
 which that will put its contents into the body of the LaTeX document,
 but before 
\family typewriter

\backslash
maketitle
\family default
 is issued.
 This is useful for making branches and notes in title-related material.
 (However,
 if you put these in a 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 layout,
 this signals to LyX to output 
\family typewriter

\backslash
maketitle
\family default
,
 which may then come too early.)

Perhaps you might want to resume the list with a different number from the next one.
 Or you want to start a new enumeration with a defined number.
 This is possible by adding an optional argument to the first list item of a normal enumeration.
 There,
 insert the command

In some cases you might want less or more vertical space between the items of a list.
 For example if the default space is too much in your opinion in this case:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_inserted 564990737 1672138150
A bullet list

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 564990737 1672138150
You can decrease the space by adding an optional argument to the first item of the list.
 Add there the command 
\family sans
nolistsep
\family default
 to get no additional list space like in this example:

 to provide nine new list environments.
 Itemized and enumerated lists can be typeset within paragraphs,
 as paragraphs and in a compact version.
 Most environments have optional arguments to format the labels.
 Additionally,
 the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 list environments itemize and enumerate are extended to use a similar optional argument.

 If you don't want one of the rules,
 set its thickness to 0.
 The header rule has a default thickness of 0.4pt,

It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested,
 and the fashionable world dismayed,
 by the murder of the Honourable Ronald Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances.
 The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out in the police investigation,
 but a good deal was suppressed upon that occasion,
 since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts.
 Only now,
 at the end of nearly ten years,
 am I allowed to supply those missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain.
 The crime was of interest in itself,
 but that interest was as nothing to me compared to the inconceivable sequel,
 which afforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life.
 Even now,
 after this long interval,
 I find myself thrilling as I think of it,
 and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy,
 amazement,
 and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind.
 Let me say to that public,
 which has shown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man,
 that they are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them,
 for I should have considered it my first duty to do so,
 had I not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips,
 which was only withdrawn upon the third of last month.

It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had interested me deeply in crime,
 and that after his disappearance I never failed to read with care the various problems which came before the public.
 And I even attempted,
 more than once,
 for my own private satisfaction,
 to employ his methods in their solution,
 though with indifferent success.
 There was none,
 however,
 which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald Adair.
 As I read the evidence at the inquest,
 which led up to a verdict of willful murder against some person or persons unknown,
 I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes.
 There were points about this strange business which would,
 I was sure,
 have specially appealed to him,
 and the efforts of the police would have been supplemented,
 or more probably anticipated,
 by the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe.
 All day,
 as I drove upon my round,
 I turned over the case in my mind and found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate.
 At the risk of telling a twice-told tale,
 I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest.

 so far as was known,
 no enemies and no particular vices.
 He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley,
 of Carstairs,
 but the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent some months before,
 and there was no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it.
 For the rest {sic} the man's life moved in a narrow and conventional circle,
 for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional.
 Yet it was upon this easy-going young aristocrat that death came,
 in most strange and unexpected form,

 the Cavendish,
 and the Bagatelle card clubs.
 It was shown that,
 after dinner on the day of his death,
 he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club.
 He had also played there in the afternoon.

The evidence of those who had played with him
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

– Mr.
 Murray,
 Sir John Hardy,
 and Colonel Moran
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

– showed that the game was whist,
 and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards.
 Adair might have lost five pounds,
 but not more.
 His fortune was a considerable one,
 and such a loss could not in any way affect him.
 He had played nearly every day at one club or other,
 but he was a cautious player,
 and usually rose a winner.
 It came out in evidence that,
 in partnership with Colonel Moran,
 he had actually won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting,
 some weeks before,
 from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral.
 So much for his recent history as it came out at the inquest.

On the evening of the crime,
 he returned from the club exactly at ten.
 His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation.
 The servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second floor,
 generally used as his sitting-room.
 She had lit a fire there,
 and as it smoked she had opened the window.
 No sound was heard from the room until eleven-twenty,
 the hour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her daughter.
 Desiring to say good-night,
 she attempted to enter her son's room.
 The door was locked on the inside,
 and no answer could be got to their cries and knocking.
 Help was obtained,
 and the door forced.
 The unfortunate young man was found lying near the table.
 His head had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet,

A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case more complex.
 In the first place,
 no reason could be given why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside.
 There was the possibility that the murderer had done this,
 and had afterwards escaped by the window.
 The drop was at least twenty feet,
 however,
 and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay beneath.
 Neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of having been disturbed,
 nor were there any marks upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road.
 Apparently,
 therefore,
 it was the young man himself who had fastened the door.
 But how did he come by his death?
 No one could have climbed up to the window without leaving traces.
 Suppose a man had fired through the window,
 he would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound.
 Again,
 Park Lane is a frequented thoroughfare;
 there is a cab stand within a hundred yards of the house.
 No one had heard a shot.

All day I turned these facts over in my mind,
 endeavouring to hit upon some theory which could reconcile them all,
 and to find that line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the starting-point of every investigation.
 I confess that I made little progress.
 In the evening I strolled across the Park,
 and found myself about six o'clock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane.
 A group of loafers upon the pavements,
 all staring up at a particular window,
 directed me to the house which I had come to see.
 A tall,
 thin man with coloured glasses,
 whom I strongly suspected of being a plain-clothes detective,
 was pointing out some theory of his own,
 while the others crowded round to listen to what he said.
 I got as near him as I could,
 but his observations seemed to me to be absurd,
 so I withdrew again in some disgust.
 As I did so I struck against an elderly,
 deformed man,
 who had been behind me,
 and I knocked down several books which he was carrying.

My observations of No.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

427 Park Lane did little to clear up the problem in which I was interested.
 The house was separated from the street by a low wall and railing,
 the whole not more than five feet high.
 It was perfectly easy,
 therefore,
 for anyone to get into the garden,
 but the window was entirely inaccessible,
 since there was no water pipe or anything which could help the most active man to climb it.
 More puzzled than ever,
 I retraced my steps to Kensington.
 I had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me.
 To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book collector,
 his sharp,
 wizened face peering out from a frame of white hair,
 and his precious volumes,
 a dozen of them at least,
 wedged under his right arm.

Shapepar paragraphs are either always centered or placed on the page so that their left border touches the left page margin.
 You can therefore not use the paragraph dialog to align such paragraphs.
 A solution is to put the paragraph into a minipage or parbox and align the box.
 The problem is hereby to find the right width for the box.
 Because if it is too wide and you center the box,
 the paragraph is not centered too because it sticks at the left side of the box.
 So you might have to play a bit with the width until it fits.
 Here are two heart-shaped paragraphs,
 the first one is not aligned,
 the second one is right-aligned:

 Each of these packages has their pros and cons,
 which cannot be listed in detail.
 If you only want to have simple author-year (or author-numerical) style,
 or if you want to use one of the countless style files for 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
natbib
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 then the established 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
natbib
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package is probably your choice.
 If you look for specific citation styles common in law studies,
 you might consider the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
jurabib
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package.
 If you want to have full control over the formatting or look for advanced features such as ibidem,
 footnote citations,
 full title citations,
 advanced date formats (such as 400 BC) or full localization to other languages than English,
 you should definitely consider 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

,
 which exceeds all other packages in terms of features,
 but is also quite heavy and more resource-hungry.

Sometimes you might need to divide your bibliography into several sections.
 If you are for instance a historian,
 the possibility to separate sources and scientific works is most likely a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

must have
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately,
 Bib\SpecialChar TeX
 itself does not allow you to do this.
 But with the help of some \SpecialChar LaTeX
 packages,
 Bib\SpecialChar TeX
 can be extended to fit your needs.
\end_layout

 The advantage of this package (compared to other packages such as 
\family typewriter
multibib
\family default
) is that you don't need to define new citation commands.
 Instead,
 you need to prepare different bibliographic databases which include the entries for the different sections of the bibliography.
 For example:
 If you want to divide your bibliography into the sections 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sources
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Scientific works
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 you first need to create two bibliographic databases,

 Now you can insert multiple Bib\SpecialChar TeX
 bibliographies,
 one for each section of your bibliography.
 Returning to our example:
 Insert the Bib\SpecialChar TeX
 bibliography 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
sources.bib
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and a second one for the database 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
scientific.bib
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 You are free to use the same or different styles for each section.
 Additionally,
 you can choose if the bibliography section should contain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all cited references
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the specified database(s) (which is the default),
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all uncited references
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or even 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all references
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This might be useful if you would like to separate your bibliography into three sections:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cited sources
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uncited sources
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Scientific works
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The titles for the sections can be added as ordinary sections or subsections.
 Since 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
bibtopic
\end_layout

\end_inset

 removes the bibliography title,
 you have to manually re-add that,
 too (as a chapter* or section*,
 for instance).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With 
\family sans
Biblatex
\family default
,
 the procedure is a bit different.
 Since 
\family typewriter

\family sans
Biblatex
\family default
,
 the aforementioned 
\begin_inset Flex Noun

 You can either add keywords to bibliography entries via the

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 in order to create the units.
 Note that this approach has some limitations.
 First,
 every citation reference has to be inside some 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
btUnit
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 So citations outside a defined unit (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.,
 before the first section if you use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

by section
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) will appear as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

???
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 You can also create your own units by entering 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

end{btUnit}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 as \SpecialChar TeX
 code (for instance to work around the mentioned limitation).
 Note,
 though,
 that 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
btUnit
\end_layout

\end_inset

s cannot be nested.
 A second limitation is that 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
bibtopic
\end_layout

\end_inset

 always processes all references of a bibliography database,
 even if they are not cited.
 This can result in odd labels (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Miller 2014b
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if two works of this author from 2014 are in the database,
 even if only one is cited).

If you use 
\family sans
Biblatex
\family default
,
 the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
refsection
\end_layout

\end_inset

 option is used instead.
 If you need specific units,
 you can start them with the \SpecialChar TeX
 code 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
newrefsection
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

 respectively.
 If you also want to control the end of the unit,
 use the environment 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_inset

 \SpecialChar ldots
 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 instead.
 Note,
 though,
 that

\begin_layout Plain Layout
refsection
\end_layout

\end_inset

s cannot be nested.
 In addition to the individual bibliography of the current unit,
 
\family sans
Biblatex
\family default
 also provides an easy way to output all bibliographies,
 subsequently,
 at one place (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

g.,

 Select 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

General Operation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are working on a large file with many sections,
 it is often convenient to break up the document into several files,
 or perhaps you have something where a table may change from time to time,
 but the preceding text does not.
 In these cases,
 you should seriously consider using multipart documents.
 For example,
 scientific papers often have five major sections:
 the introduction,
 observations,
 results,
 discussion,
 and conclusion.
 Each of these could be its own separate \SpecialChar LyX
 file,
 with one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

master
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file which contains the title,
 authors,
 abstract,
 references,
 etc.,
 plus the five included files.
 It is important to note that each of these files is a full \SpecialChar LyX
 file which can be formatted and printed on its own,
 as well as included in a master file.
 Each of these files must have the same document class,
 however—
don't attempt to mix book classes with article classes.
 You may also include \SpecialChar LaTeX
 files;
 however,
 these files must not have their own preamble (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

everything up to and including the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 With

 infinite sub-inputting is possible.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence,

Bibliography Lists in all Subdocuments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you work with child documents,
 you might want to have only one main bibliography at the end,
 but still be able to have a selected bibliography for the child if you output it on its own.
 Here is how to achieve this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the main document,
 you just insert a bibliography inset at the place where the main bibliography has to appear (within the master file or within a child).
 If the bibliography inset is in the master file,
 the references will be inherited by all children,
 so they are available in the citation dialog within each child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For child-specific bibliographies,
 insert bibliography insets within the child documents,
 at the place where the bibliography should appear when the child is compiled separately.
 However,
 the trick is to insert them into a branch (
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar menuseparator
Branch\SpecialChar menuseparator
Insert New Branch...
\family default
),
 e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Childonly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Within the children,
 activate the branch (
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings...\SpecialChar menuseparator
Branches
\family default
).
 Within the master,
 deactivate the branch (
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings...\SpecialChar menuseparator
Branches
\family default
).
 Now the child's bibliography will be ignored by the master,
 but considered by the child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you need multiple bibliographies (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.,
 one per child in the 
\emph on

\emph default
),

 document class,
 all you get is a centered page number at the bottom of the page.
 This document uses KOMA-script's book class,
 so it appears to be a bit fancier.
 But to really put on a show,
 you need to set the document page style to

 The footer is also divided into these three fields.
 The \SpecialChar LaTeX

\begin_layout Chapter
\SpecialChar LyX
 and the World Wide Web
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 has long supported the export of documents to various web-friendly formats,
 such as HTML.
 Before version 2.0,
 however,
 HTML export was always accomplished by the use of external converters.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For details on the use of external converters with \SpecialChar LyX
,
 see the 
\emph on
Converters
\emph default
 section of the Customization manual.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 These fall into two large groups:
 there are converters that use \SpecialChar LaTeX
 as an intermediate format,
 such as 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
htlatex
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
html2latex
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
plastex
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 relying upon \SpecialChar LyX
 to produce the \SpecialChar LaTeX
;
 and there is a converter that works directly on \SpecialChar LyX
 files,
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
e\SpecialChar LyX
er
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 All of these have different advantages and disadvantages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The \SpecialChar LaTeX
-based converters have the advantage that,
 in principle,
 they know everything about the exported document that \SpecialChar LaTeX
 does.
 Such converters do not care,
 for example,
 if a certain block of code was produced by \SpecialChar LyX
 or was Evil Red Text.
 These converters know about 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
aux
\end_layout

\end_inset

 files,
 counters,
 and references,
 and can often make use of the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
bbl
\end_layout

\end_inset

 files generated by Bib\SpecialChar TeX
.
 On the other hand,
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is a very hard language to parse—
it is sometimes said that only \SpecialChar TeX
 itself understands \SpecialChar TeX
—
and \SpecialChar LaTeX
-based converters will often choke on what seem to be quite simple constructs;
 complex ones can throw them completely,
 and as of this writing,
 for example,
 the 
\emph on
Embedded Objects
\emph default
 manual will not export with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
htlatex
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 though the others will.
 The other issue concerns how math is handled.
 These converters typically convert the formulae into little pictures that are then linked from the HTML document.
 Since these are actually generated by \SpecialChar LaTeX
,
 they are accurate.
 But they do not scale well,
 and just getting them to look as if they are actually meant to be in your document—
so that the font sizes seem to be roughly the same—
can be a challenge.

\begin_inset CommandInset href

) solves some of these problems.
 In particular,
 the formulae it produces scale perfectly,
 since it renders math using a combination of HTML and CSS rather than converting the formulae to images.
 But even moderately complex formula are rendered less well than with 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

;
 this reflects the limitations of HTML.

 but this setting is only available globally and requires one to have access to a server that runs the backend.

 More importantly (as of version 1.1.1,
 at least),
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
e\SpecialChar LyX

 has limited support for math macros and no support for user-defined paragraph or character styles.
 These limitations make 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
e\SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\end_inset

 unsuitable for many of the documents \SpecialChar LyX
 users produce.
 In principle,
 of course,
 these problems could be solved,
 but the \SpecialChar LyX
 developers have decided to follow a different path and have made \SpecialChar LyX
 itself capable of writing XHTML,
 just as it is capable of writing \SpecialChar LaTeX
,
 DocBook,
 and plaintext.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of this writing,
 XHTML output remains under development and should probably be regarded as

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Still,
 the developers have chosen this approach because it has several potential advantages over the other two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These advantages are primarily due to the fact that the XHTML output routines,
 since they are part of \SpecialChar LyX
,
 know everything \SpecialChar LyX
 knows about the document being exported.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another advantage is that,
 since these routines are internal to \SpecialChar LyX
,
 they are immune to changes in \SpecialChar LyX
's file format,
 or to changes in the semantics of existing insets.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 So they know about the table of contents (as displayed in the outline),
 about the counters associated with different paragraph styles,
 and about user-defined styles.
 The XHTML output routines know what \SpecialChar LyX
 knows about internationalization,
 too,
 so they will output 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Chapter 1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\lang ngerman
Kapitel
\lang english
 1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 depending upon the language in effect at the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quite generally,
 the output routines know what \SpecialChar LyX
 knows about document layout,
 that is,
 about how the document is to be rendered on screen.
 We use this information when we output the document as XHTML.
 In particular,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 
\emph on
automatically
\emph default
 generates CSS style information corresponding to the layout information it uses to render the document on screen:
 if section headings are supposed to be sans-serif and bold as seen in \SpecialChar LyX
,
 then (by default) they will be sans-serif and bold when viewed in a web browser,
 too.
 And this is true not just for pre-defined styles,
 like Section,
 but for any style,
 including user-defined styles.
 Indeed,
 the XHTML output routines make no distinction between user-defined paragraph and 
\change_deleted 244031559 1603876931
character
\change_inserted 244031559 1603876940
text
\change_unchanged
 styles and \SpecialChar LyX
's own pre-defined styles:
 in each case,
 everything \SpecialChar LyX
 knows about the styles is contained in the layout files.
 And much the same is true as regards pre-defined textual insets,
 such as footnotes,
 and various custom insets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result is that XHTML output can be customized and extended in exactly the same way \SpecialChar LaTeX
 output can be customized and extended:
 through layout files and modules.
 See chapter five of the 
\emph on
Customization 
\emph default
manual for the details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this chapter contains more detailed information on XHTML output,
 its limitations,
 and ways to work around those limitations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Math Output in XHTML
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 offers four choices for how math is rendered.
 These have various advantages and disadvantages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MathML
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

MathML is a dialect of XML designed specifically for mathematics on the web,
 and it typically renders very well in browsers that support it.
 The disadvantage is that not all browsers support MathML,
 and support is not complete even in the Gecko-based browsers,
 such as Firefox.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If \SpecialChar LyX
 is unable to render a formula as MathML—
for example,
 if the formula uses the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
xymatrix
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package or ERT—
then it will instead output the formula as an image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HTML
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

As mentioned above,
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
elyxer
\end_layout

\end_inset

 outputs math as HTML,
 styled by CSS.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\SpecialChar LyX
 has borrowed some of the CSS for its HTML output from 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
elyxer
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For simple formulae,
 this can work quite well,
 though with more complicated formulae it tends to break down.
 Still,
 this method has the advantage that it is very widely supported and so it may be appropriate for documents that contain only a little,
 fairly simple math.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If Lyx is unable to render a formula as HTML—
for example,
 if the formula uses the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
xymatrix
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package or ERT—
then it will instead output the formula as an image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Images
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Like 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
htlatex
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will output formulae as images,
 the very same images,
 in fact,
 that are used for instant preview.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Instant preview does 
\emph on
not 
\emph default
have to be on for images to be output,
 however.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The advantage to this method is that the images are simply generated by \SpecialChar LaTeX
,
 so they are very accurate.
 The disadvantage,
 as mentioned earlier,
 is that these are bitmapped images,
 so they do not scale terribly well,
 and one cannot copy them,
 etc.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The size of the images can be controlled by setting the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If \SpecialChar LyX
 for some reason fails to create an image for a formula (e.g.,
 if a required \SpecialChar LaTeX
 package is not installed),
 then it will fall back to outputing the raw \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\SpecialChar LaTeX

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Finally,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will happily output math as \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 As well as being the output of last resort,
 this method can be used with such tools as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "jsMath"
target "http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 which uses JavaScript to render \SpecialChar LaTeX
 embedded in HTML documents.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 wraps the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 in either a 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
span
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (for inline formulas) or 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 (for displayed formulas) with 
\begin_inset Flex Code

,
 as is required for jsMath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of these output methods must be selected under

 By default,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 outputs MathML.
 This is a document-wide setting,
 therefore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eventually,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will offer the user the option to select an alternate output method for a particular inset,
 say,
 one that isn't being rendered very well by MathML.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
That said,
 since \SpecialChar LyX
 falls back to images if the inset contains ERT,
 then one can force output as an image by putting some harmless ERT into the math,
 for example:
 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b\relax$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bibliography and Citations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XHTML output fully supports bibliographies and citations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Citation labels are generated by the same machinery that generates \SpecialChar LyX
's on-screen labels,
 so the labels will look in the output much as they do in \SpecialChar LyX
,
 though better.
 If you are using numerical citations,
 then \SpecialChar LyX
 will output numerical labels,
 such as [1] or [17],
 rather than simply showing the citation key in square brackets,
 as it does on-screen.
 If you are using author-year citations,
 then \SpecialChar LyX
 will add lowercase letters to the years,
 just as Bib\SpecialChar TeX
 does,
 if it finds more than one citation for a given author-year combination.
 The labels will be printed with the bibliography entries.
 Note that there is,
 at present,
 no way to customize the appearance of the labels,
 for example,
 to choose between square brackets and parentheses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bibliography output is handled by the same machinery that handles the presentation of reference information in the citation dialog,
 so you will see in the XHTML output pretty much what you would see if you were to look at a given entry in the citation dialog.
 The formatting can be customized in your layout file or,
 preferably,
 in a module.
 See the 
\emph on
Customization
\emph default
 manual for the details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main defect at present is that cross-referenced information is printed with every entry with which it is associated.
 So you can see things like this:

 itself does not really handle these.
 It just lets you enter what you would have to enter in raw \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We'll describe how they are handled using the subsection headings from that section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Grouping Index Entries (aka,
 sub-entries):
 \SpecialChar LyX
 makes an effort to support these,
 but the entries must be separated by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 !
 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 that is,
 there must be spaces around the exclamation point.
 This is because it is otherwise too difficult to check for escaped exclamation points,
 ones in math,
 and so forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Page Ranges:
 There is no support at all for page ranges,
 since these make no sense with XHMTL.
 Instead,
 you will just get two index entries,
 one at either end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cross-referencing:
 There is no support for cross-referencing.
 If \SpecialChar LyX
 finds an entry containing the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

|see\SpecialChar ldots

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 construct,
 it is just dropped,
 and the rest is treated as an ordinary index entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Index Entry Order:
 \SpecialChar LyX
 does support attempts to fix the sorting order.
 It will take what is before the first `@' it finds and use that for sorting,
 taking what follows the first `@' to be the actual entry.
 At present,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 does not check for escaped `@',
 so do not try to index email addresses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Index Entry Layout:
 You can format entries by using the text style dialog,
 or by using any other method available within \SpecialChar LyX
 itself.
 There is no support for constructs like:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

entry|textbf
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Indeed,
 if \SpecialChar LyX
 finds a pipe symbol,
 `|',
 in an entry,
 it will delete it and everything that follows it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multiple Indexes:
 There is no support for multiple indexes.
 Rather,
 all index entries will be printed as one large index.
 To avoid our printing several versions of the index,
 we print only the main index,
 so make sure you have one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Nomenclature and Glossary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is at present no support for glossaries.
 Adding it would be fairly trivial,
 and welcome.

DocBook Output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 1075283030 1616534386
Apart from HTML,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 can generate documents in the DocBook XML vocabulary.
 With versions 2.3 and before,
 only select templates could be used to generate DocBook documents (only version 4).
 Starting with \SpecialChar LyX
 2.4,
 most \SpecialChar LyX
 layouts can generate valid DocBook documents (only version 5).
 This feature is built into \SpecialChar LyX
 and does not require the use of external tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 1075283030 1616534437
The result is that the DocBook output can be customized and extended in exactly the same way \SpecialChar LaTeX
 output can be customized and extended:
 through layout files and modules.
 See chapter five of the 
\emph on
Customization 
\emph default
manual for the details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 1075283030 1616534475
Most \SpecialChar LyX
 features are supported with DocBook,
 like math output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_inserted 1075283030 1616534741
Math output is performed mostly in MathML (the major exception being constructions not supported by \SpecialChar LyX
,
 i.e.
 ERTs).
 All formulae are also available in raw \SpecialChar TeX
 in the DocBook output for further processing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_inserted 1075283030 1616534852
Bibliographies and citations are implemented,
 including with an external BibTeX file.
 Bibliography entries are not prerendered when the detailed information are available,
 but rather output with the standard DocBook constructs.
 The external DocBook processor is expected to handle the rendering of entries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_inserted 1075283030 1616534863
Indexes are supported,
 including multiple indices.
 Grouping (with

 with the exception of the same symbols escaped.
 Entry order (

 There is no support for escaping of index entries.

\begin_layout Itemize

Format for tables:
 \SpecialChar LyX
 can generate tables either as HTML (default value) or CALS,
 depending on the user's requirements.
 Most DocBook processors accept both formats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_inserted 1075283030 1616535006
MathML prefix:
 in DocBook,
 MathML is included within its own name space,
 unlike HTML.
 The implication is that there must be an indication of the tags belonging to the MathML standard.
 Three choices are offered:
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\change_inserted 1075283030 1616535044
Inline:
 the MathML name space is defined for each formula (using the

 attribute on each formula)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_inserted 1075283030 1616535090
With the 
\family typewriter
m
\family default
 prefix (default):
 the MathML name space is defined at the document level (using the 
\family typewriter
xmlns:m
\family default
 attribute on the root element).
 Each MathML is prefixed with 
\family typewriter
m
\family default
:
 for instance,
 
\family typewriter
m:math
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_inserted 1075283030 1616620405

 option,
 but with

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 1075283030 1616620470
This option is especially useful if you want \SpecialChar LyX
 to match your personal style or to work with buggy software that only accepts one prefix for MathML.

The \SpecialChar LyX
 Server
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The `\SpecialChar LyX
 server' allows other programs to talk to \SpecialChar LyX
,
 invoke \SpecialChar LyX
 commands,
 and retrieve information about the \SpecialChar LyX
 internal state.
 This is only intended for advanced users,
 but they should find it useful.
 It is by writing to the \SpecialChar LyX
 server,
 for example,
 that bibliography managers,
 such as JabRef,
 are able to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

push
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 citations to \SpecialChar LyX
.

\begin_layout Standard
The \SpecialChar LyX
 server works through the use of a pair of named pipes.
 These are usually located in 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_inset

,
 (except on Windows,

 You

\end_layout

\end_inset

' to create the pipes.
 If one of the pipes already exists,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will assume that another \SpecialChar LyX
 process is already running and will not start the server.
 On POSIX (Unix like) systems,
 if for some other reason,
 an unused 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pipe is left in existence when \SpecialChar LyX
 closes,
 then \SpecialChar LyX
 will try to delete it.
 If this fails for some reason,
 you will need to delete the pipes manually and then restart \SpecialChar LyX
.
 On Windows,
 pipes are deleted by the OS on program termination or crash,
 so 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pipes should not be possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To have several \SpecialChar LyX
 processes with servers at the same time,
 you have to use different configurations,
 perhaps by using separate user directories,
 each with its own 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_inset

 file,
 for each process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are developing a client program,
 you might find it useful to enable debugging information from the \SpecialChar LyX
 server.
 Do this by starting \SpecialChar LyX
 as 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
lyx -dbg lyxserver
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Another useful tool is the command-line based client found in 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/client/lyxclient
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Normal communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To issue a \SpecialChar LyX
 call,
 the client writes a line of ASCII text into the input pipe.
 This line has the following format:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
LYXCMD:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
function
\emph default
:
\emph on
argument
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
clientname is a name that the client can choose arbitrarily.
 Its only use is that \SpecialChar LyX
 will echo it if it sends an answer—
so a client can dispatch results from different requesters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
function is the function you want \SpecialChar LyX
 to perform.
 It is the same as the commands you'd use in the minibuffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
argument is an optional argument which is meaningful only to some functions (for instance,
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self-insert
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 LFUN will insert the argument as text at the cursor position).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The answer from \SpecialChar LyX
 will arrive in the output pipe and be of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
INFO:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
function
\emph default
:
\emph on
data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
function
\emph default
 are just echoed from the command request,
 while 
\emph on
data
\emph default
 is more or less useful information filled according to how the command execution worked out.
 Some commands,
 such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

font-state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 will return information about the internal state of \SpecialChar LyX
,
 while other will return an empty data-response.
 This means that the command execution went fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case of errors,
 the response from \SpecialChar LyX
 will have this form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
ERROR:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
function
\emph default
:
\emph on
error message
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the 
\emph on
error message
\emph default
 should contain an explanation of why the command failed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
echo "LYXCMD:test:beginning-of-buffer:" >~/.lyxpipe.in
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

echo "LYXCMD:test:get-xy:" >~/.lyxpipe.in

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

echo $a
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
AppleScript (Mac OS X)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 supports basic interactions with AppleScript for normal communication through the command run.
 This command takes a direct argument (the 
\series bold
function
\series default
 to perform) and an optional argument.
 It either returns the output of the function or triggers an error with the error message and code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
tell application "\SpecialChar LyX
"
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  try
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    -- Stores the current file name into f
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    set f to (run "server-get-filename" with argument "")
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    on error the error_message number the error_number
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
      display dialog "Error:
 " & the error_number & ".
 " ¬
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
              & the error_message buttons {"OK"} default button 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  end try
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
end tell
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Notification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 can notify clients of events going on asynchronously.
 Currently it will only do this if the user binds a key sequence with the function 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

notify
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The format of the string \SpecialChar LyX
 sends is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
NOTIFY:
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph on
key-sequence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
key-sequence
\emph default
 is the printed representation of the key sequence that was actually typed by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This mechanism can be used to extend \SpecialChar LyX
's command set and implement macros.
 Bind some key sequence to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

notify
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Then start a client that listens on the output pipe,
 dispatches the command according to the sequence,
 and starts a function that may use \SpecialChar LyX
 calls and \SpecialChar LyX
 requests to issue a command or a series of commands to \SpecialChar LyX
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The simple \SpecialChar LyX
 Server Protocol
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 implements a simple protocol that can be used for session management.
 All messages are of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
LYXSRV:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
protocol message
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
protocol message
\emph default
 can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hello
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bye
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hello
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is received from a client,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will report back to inform the client that it's listening to it's messages,
 while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bye
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sent from \SpecialChar LyX
 will inform clients that \SpecialChar LyX
 is closing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Reverse DVI/PDF search
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some DVI/PDF viewers
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The following viewers offer the reverse PDF search feature:
 Okular on KDE/Linux,
 Qpdfview on Unix,
 Skim on Mac OSX and SumatraPDF on Windows.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 provide 
\emph on
reverse search
\emph default
 facility (also called 
\emph on
inverse search
\emph default
).
 This means that you can tell \SpecialChar LyX
 to put the cursor to a specific line in the document by clicking at the respective position in the DVI/PDF output.
 To achieve this,
 the viewer must be able to communicate with \SpecialChar LyX
.
 This is done via the \SpecialChar LyX
 server either by using the named pipe (
\emph on
lyxpipe
\emph default
),
 or the UNIX domain socket (
\emph on
lyxsocket
\emph default
) that \SpecialChar LyX
 creates in its temporary directory (this is the way the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
lyxclient
\end_layout

\end_inset

 program communicates with \SpecialChar LyX
).
 In some cases,
 you need a helper script that mediates between the viewer and \SpecialChar LyX
,
 in others,
 the viewer can communicate with \SpecialChar LyX
 directly.
 This depends on the selected viewer and on your operating system.
 The same applies to the way viewers need to be configured and the way the reverse search is actually performed.
 In what follows,
 we will thus describe how to setup reverse search for specific viewers.
 Before we turn to this,
 though,
 we will explain what needs to be done generally to enable reverse search in the DVI/PDF output.
\end_layout

External Packages (PDFSync and scrltx) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The packages 
\emph on
pdfsync
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
scrltx
\emph default
 provide reverse search facility for PDF output (via pdflatex) and DVI output,
 respectively.
 In order to enable it,
 load the packages in the \SpecialChar LyX
 preamble:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
usepackage{pdfsync}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for reverse PDF search,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
usepackage[active]{srcltx}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for reverse DVI search.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to be able to perform both DVI and PDF reverse searches,
 you can also insert in the preamble the following lines
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
usepackage{ifpdf}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\backslash
ifpdf
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

  
\backslash
usepackage{pdfsync}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\backslash
else
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

  
\backslash
usepackage[active]{srcltx}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\backslash
fi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This way,
 you can preview the file as either DVI or PDF (pdflatex) and the right package will be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that PDFSync might affect the output layout of your document.
 It is therefore advised to disable PDFsync for final documents.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Built-in reverse search via Sync\SpecialChar TeX
 (DVI and PDF) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent versions of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(pdf)latex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 have built-in support for both PDF and DVI reverse search.
 This so-called 
\emph on
Sync\SpecialChar TeX

\emph default
 facility is basically the result of the integration of the PDFSync package to the pdftex program and its merge with the 
\emph on
scr-specials
\emph default
 approach.
 You need at least \SpecialChar TeX
Live 2008 or a recent Mik\SpecialChar TeX
 distribution in order to use it.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For some reason,
 Mik\SpecialChar TeX
 does not understand/obey the command \SpecialChar LyX
 inserts into the preamble when you check the "Enable Forward/Reverse Search" button in the toolbar and does not generate the necessary info.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The generation of the required info can be forced by changing the converter "\SpecialChar LaTeX
 (pdflatex) -> PDF (pdflatex)" in Preferences->File handling->Converters from the default "pdflatex $$i" to "pdflatex -synctex=1 $$i" (i.e.,
 by adding the -synctex=1 switch).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Also note that only a few PDF viewers (such as Okular and Qpdfview on Unix,
 Skim on the Mac,
 SumatraPDF on Windows;
 see the next section for details) already provide Sync\SpecialChar TeX
 support.

 While many of the widespread PDF viewers (most notably Adobe Reader) do not support forward search at all,
 some other viewers – e.

 This latter functionality is provided by an external call of synctex (see the predefined example configurations).

Forward search works both with DVI and PDF output.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 simply checks which preview format you have used before (i.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted 564990737 1669742044
Please note that the publisher of the journal was changed from Springer to EDP Sciences starting January 1,
 2001.
 That change involved also some slight changes to the style files,
 namely the removal of the thesaurus command.
 The \SpecialChar LyX
 class aa supports the newest version of these style files,
 V 5.01.
 If you have an older version installed,
 please upgrade.
 For compatibility,
 the old (version 4) layout has been kept as

 this is done automatically by \SpecialChar LyX

 Although the order of the single header entries doesn't matter it is advised to keep the above sequence,
 just to get the best optics and meets the layout of the real document.
\end_layout

 just use the standard footnote via the menu

The ijmpc package is a set of macros that facilitates electronic manuscript submission to the

\emph default
.
 Similarly,
 the ijmpd package is for creating manuscripts to be submitted to the 
\emph on

 Both journals are published by World Scientific.
 The corresponding document classes are named 
\family typewriter
ws-ijmpc.cls

 respectively.

Writing a paper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted 564990737 1669755802
As usual,
 the easiest way to write a paper is to start with a template.
 Click on

\family sans
Template
\family default
,
 then choose the 
\family typewriter
ijmpc.lyx
\family default
 or

\family default
 template.
 This will give an (almost) empty document that includes the most common fields found in a manuscript.
 Simply overwrite the existing text (including the brackets,
 
\family typewriter

\family default
) with your text.
 You should keep in mind the following remarks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\change_deleted 564990737 1669755802

The ijmpc and the ijmpd packages use the 
\family typewriter
tbl
\family default
 command to implement table captions.
 As a result,
 a table created by \SpecialChar LyX
 is printed correctly,
 but its caption is ignored.
 However,
 you can use some \SpecialChar TeX
 code to overcome this problem,
 so that captions are printed as expected.
 To do so,
 create a float table as usual,
 remove the caption,
 and replace it with the \SpecialChar TeX
 code 
\family typewriter

\backslash
tbl{
\emph on
your table caption
\emph default
}{
\family default

 you must also the \SpecialChar TeX
 code 
\family typewriter
}
\family default

 Study the example table included in the template files to see how this trick is implemented.
 Alternatively,
 If you need table captions,
 you should implement the whole table float in a 
\family typewriter
.tex
\family default
 file,
 then include this file to the \SpecialChar LyX
 document (

These files are partly based on the older 
\family typewriter
ejour2.layout
\family default
,
 which was again based on a tinkered-with version of an old \SpecialChar LaTeX
 2.09 style file from Springer.
 All this,
 and the

 layout,
 are now defunct.
 Jean-Marc Lasgouttes helped out big in making me find my way around the \SpecialChar LyX

 in frustration because some constructs in \SpecialChar LaTeX

 The program runs over your \SpecialChar LaTeX

 In other technical words,
 it is

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well,
 what is a syntax checker doing in \SpecialChar LyX
 which is supposed to produce correct \SpecialChar LaTeX
 anyways?
 The answer is simple:
 Just as 
\family typewriter
Lint
\family default
 not only checks the 
\emph on
syntax
\emph default
 of C programs,
 but also does 
\emph on
semantic
\emph default
 checks for type-errors,
 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 catches some common 
\emph on
typographic
\emph default
 errors,
 in addition to the syntactical ones.
 Specifically,
 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 is capable of detecting several common errors,
 such as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ellipsis detection:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Use \SpecialChar ldots
 instead of ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No space in front of/after parenthesis:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

( wrong spacing )
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enforcement of normal space after common abbreviations:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

is too wide spacing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enforcement of end-of-sentence space when the last sentence ends with a capital letter:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is a TEST.
 And this is wrong spacing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Space in front of labels and similar commands:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The label should stick right up to the text to avoid falling to a wrong page.

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Space in front of references,
 instead of hard spaces:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If you have bad luck,
 the text will break right between the referenced text and reference number,

\begin_layout Subsection
How to use it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have the program installed,
 usage is as simple as choosing 
\family sans
Tools\SpecialChar menuseparator
Check
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

TeX
\family default
.
 This will make \SpecialChar LyX
 generate a \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file of your document,
 start 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 to check it,
 and then make \SpecialChar LyX
 insert 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

error boxes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the warnings from 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
,
 if there were any.
 The warnings will be placed close to the point of the mistake,
 and you can quickly find them by using the 
\family sans
Navigate\SpecialChar menuseparator
Error
\family default
 menu item,
 or the shortcut key 
\family sans
C-g
\family default
 from the default 
\family typewriter
cua
\family default
 bind file.
 Open the error boxes by clicking on them with the mouse,
 or use the shortcut key 
\family sans
C-i
\family default
 from 
\family typewriter
cua
\family default
 bindings,
 or the corresponding 
\family sans
C-o
\family default
 for the alternate 
\family typewriter
emacs
\family default
 bind file.
 Read the warning and correct the mistake,
 if it is a mistake.
 If you have trouble understanding what the warning is about,
 you can safely ignore it.
 Remember that there is a hidden layer between the document on screen and the technical details in invoking 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
,
 and this gap can make some warnings seem arcane or just plain silly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is an excellent testing bed for the feature,
 and it should provide quite a few warnings for you to fiddle with.
 Since computers are only so smart,
 expect most of the warnings to be false alarms,
 though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How to fine tune it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes,
 you'll find that 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 makes more noise than suits your mood.
 Then you can choose not to use it,
 wait until your mood changes,
 or try to customize 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 to get better along with you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default

is
\emph default
 very configurable and extensible,
 you should not expect to solve all problems with 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 in \SpecialChar LyX
 this way.
 Since \SpecialChar LyX

 Invoked in this way,
 it can be a hassle to find the corresponding place in the document inside \SpecialChar LyX

 but with a little patience,
 you should be able to do it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here follows the warning messages that can be enabled and disabled in

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (a man file,
 read it with

Before you begin to use the version control features in \SpecialChar LyX

 you should be familiar with RCS/CVS/SVN/GIT usage.
 The implementation in \SpecialChar LyX
 assumes a recent version of the GNU RCS or CVS/SVN package —
 no guarantees are made for older versions.

 you can check them in the Messages pane if you are unsure.

General CVS usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you start from scratch with CVS you have to create your repository and checkout the working copy with external tools.
 If you're using a client-server setup you may need to login before doing the first repository checkout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your documents are under revision control and others are using the same repository problems arise when different changes to the same document at the same location happen.
 Standard CVS repositories don't operate with a file locking mechanism.
 This may be surprising,
 but conflicts only occur if people disagree on the proper content of the same part of a document.
 So,
 if co-workers are used to communicate regularly,
 these conflicts occur rarely.
 If they don't communicate they have a fundamental problem anyway.
 Nevertheless some people like to work with so called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reserved checkouts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If they do so the working copy of all files is readonly when checked out first and the user starts editing after using a special command to make the working copy writable.
 When the changes are checked in the working copy returns to readonly state.
 With \SpecialChar LyX
 one has to edit the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.cvsrc
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file and add the line 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
cvs -r
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to work with reserved checkouts.
 The benefit is the possibility to see who is using a writable copy of some document.
 It's not guaranteed only one user makes a copy writable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 tries to guess if you're using reserved or non-reserved checkouts.
 If your working copy is readonly or it is writable and an additional copy of your document exists in the CVS/Base sub-directory a reserved otherwise a non-reserved checkout is assumed.
 When a reserved checkout is detected you have to use 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Check Out
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to make your working copy writable if it's readonly.
 After doing so the 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Check In
\end_layout

 operation is possible and that makes your working copy readonly again after transferring your changes to the repository.

 If this property is detected for a given document \SpecialChar LyX
 starts to use SVN locks for document editing automatically and the whole check-in/out mechanism switches to the same regimen as for RCS.
 This in particular means there are two different modes of file use in \SpecialChar LyX
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unlocked state.
 The loaded file is in the read-only mode.
 For editing on needs to check-out.

Another—
a hacking one—
possibility is to use svn keywords
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.advanced.props.special.keywords.html
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In short – you set file keywords property (e.g.
 
\family sans
svn propset svn:keywords 'Rev' file.lyx
\family default
) and then paste keyword \SpecialChar TeX
 code
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is an easy way how to ensure that \SpecialChar LyX
 won't break the line in the middle of keyword tag.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 tag in your document (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
$Rev$
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 This way svn client will automatically substitute revision number (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
$Rev:
 59 $
\end_layout

\end_inset

) after each update and commit.
 There are more problems with this approach.
 Firstly,
 the '$' character is used in \SpecialChar TeX
 world for math equations,
 so any occurence of math formula 
\begin_inset Formula $Rev$
\end_inset

 become 
\begin_inset Formula $Rev:59$
\end_inset

 in your \SpecialChar LyX
 document.
 Similarly for other keywords like Id,
 Date,
 Author,
 etc.
 Secondly svn output is dependent on your locales,
 so its very easy that svn would produce some problematic strings once Date is used.
 Thirdly you get the whole 'Rev:
 59' string in your document instead of the plain number.
 Until subversion implements user's custom keywords it will be hard to use this approach reliably or let \SpecialChar LyX
 to support it directly.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Preparation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to installing \SpecialChar LyX
,
 and having access to a Subversion repository,
 the user will need to install the Subversion client program.
 A Windows installer for the client program is available from 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "CollabNet"
target "http://www.collab.net/nonav/downloads/subversion/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The user may also want to install 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "TortoiseSVN"
target "http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 which integrates Subversion operations into the context (rightclick) menu of Windows Explorer.
 Operations done outside \SpecialChar LyX
 will typically be more convenient using the Explorer context menu.
 Note that TortoiseSVN is not a replacement for the client program,
 which is what \SpecialChar LyX
 itself will use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bringing a document under Subversion control
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before a \SpecialChar LyX
 document can be brought under version control in Subversion,
 its parent directory needs to be under version control.
 If the document is being added to a project already in the repository,
 this is accomplished by checking the project out to the directory where the new document will be placed.
 If the project itself is not yet under version control (for instance,
 if this document starts a new project),
 the directory must be imported into the repository.
 This is done outside \SpecialChar LyX
.
 Both import and checkout are easily accomplished from the Explorer context menu using TortoiseSVN,
 or alternatively can be done using the command line client at a DOS prompt.
 The procedure for importing the project using TortoiseSVN is described below,
 assuming an existing repository and a new project being started in 
\family typewriter
C:
\backslash

\family default
.
 For information on using the Subversion client program,
 run

\begin_layout Standard
One big difference of GIT and the other supported version control systems is the distributed nature of GIT:
 With traditional version control systems there is one central server which hosts the repository.
 Users commit their changes to the server,
 and get updates made by other users from it.
 With GIT,
 users commit to a local repository.
 The local repository can be synchronized with one or more remote repositories using the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

Further tuning

\begin_layout Standard
With the recent addition of the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
vc-command
\end_layout

\end_inset

 function \SpecialChar LyX
 power users are allowed to create their own commands for revision control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example you can see how two TortoiseSVN commands could be integrated directly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Commit:
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
vc-command DR "." "TortoiseProc /command:commit /path:$$p"
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Revert:
 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
vc-command DR "." "TortoiseProc /command:revert /path:$$p"
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Version control and Document comparison
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the typical uses of version control is to inspect the changes between revisions,
 usually by creating 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
diff
\end_layout

\end_inset

 dumps.
 While this is useful for plain text files,
 it is much less useful in the case of \SpecialChar LyX
 files,
 which have more a complicated structure.
 Hence we provide binding to the Document comparison feature.
 There are two ways of calling this feature – either by direct call of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
vc-compare
\end_layout

\end_inset

 \SpecialChar LyX
 function (for details see \SpecialChar LyX
 functions manual) or by the toolbar icon 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "vc-compare"
\end_inset

 or the menu item 
\begin_inset Info
type  "menu"
arg   "vc-compare"
\end_inset

,
 respectively.
 One can either compare two chosen revisions of the document or he can simply compare the current version of edited text with older revisions (where '
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
0
\end_layout

\end_inset

' revisions back means comparison of the edited file with last commited revision).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature is supported for SVN and RCS though due to the more complicated versioning scheme of RCS there is a constraint – when addressing the revisions in dialog,
 numbers always point to the last number in RCS revision number,
 i.e.
 '35' in '1.2.35'.
 We don't currently support GIT addressing of revisions,
 one can just compare edited document with its revision X steps backs,
 where X is addressed as 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
HEAD~X
\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
From the Literate Programming FAQ:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Literate programming is the combination of documentation and source together in a fashion suited for reading by human beings.
 In fact,
 literate programs should be enjoyable reading,
 even inviting!
 (Sorry Bob,
 I couldn't resist!) In general,
 literate programs combine source and documentation in a single file.
 Literate programming tools then parse the file to produce either readable documentation or compilable source.
 The WEB style of literate programming was created by D.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

E.
 Knuth during the development of his \SpecialChar TeX
 typesetting software.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Using the noweb module
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have installed Noweb and \SpecialChar LyX
 successfully,
 whenever you open a new document,
 after you have chosen its document class,
 use the 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings
\family default
 menu to add the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

noweb
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 If Noweb is correctly installed,
 when you click on the

 you will see the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space \space{}

\SpecialChar LyX
 should be prevented from making any special interpretation of what has been written.
 This is also handled by 
\begin_inset Flex Noun

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 that works like a normal text inset but has a free spacing capability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a special note,
 you can also use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

%def
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 construct of Noweb in your chunks to add items to Noweb's identifier cross-reference:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout LyX-Code
def some_function(args):

For an example of this usage and the resulting cross-reference output,
 look at the Literate python program in

\begin_layout Paragraph
Generating the documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point you already have a new document file with a proper document class,
 and with some code and text on it.
 How do I print it?
 The answer is simple,
 you select 
\family sans
View\SpecialChar menuseparator
DVI,

\family default
 etc.
 Just like you would do for a plain document.
 No special procedure is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To help orientate you,
 I will now explain what happens inside \SpecialChar LyX
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When the 
\family sans
Update\SpecialChar menuseparator
DVI
\family default
 menu option is chosen,
 a \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file is generated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If the document is of any literate class the generated file will be named with an extension name defined by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

literate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 format (defined in the Preferences panel),
 otherwise the file will have the usual 
\family typewriter
.tex
\family default
 extension.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Note that the only difference so far is in the name of the file,
 no special processing is required by \SpecialChar LyX
.
 Given that you formatted the code using the 
\begin_inset Flex Noun

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 inset that,
 by itself,
 takes care of the business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 will then use the internal \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise it will just skip this step.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally,
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is invoked and the regular post processing continues as in a plain document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Independence from a particular 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

literate tool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is easily achieved by changing the commands that are run by the various converters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Generating the code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the build menu option is chosen or the corresponding button in the toolbar is pressed,
 a \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file is generated just like step 1 above.
 Next,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 invokes the 
\family typewriter
Noweb->Program
\family default
 converter.
 This converter needs to be defined by the user and is not installed by default,
 though the Program format is.
 This converter (like any other converter) will have two parts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The converter program itself.
 This program performs the conversion from the one format to the other (in this case,
 from the Noweb format to the Program pseudo-format).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The error log parser.
 This is a program whose sole purpose is to rewrite error messages in a format that \SpecialChar LyX
 understands.
 This makes it possible for \SpecialChar LyX
 to place error boxes in the right places in the file buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part,
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Converter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 setting,
 should be set to
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
build-script $$i
\family default
 $$r
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This basically means that \SpecialChar LyX
 will call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (a program or script) with the name of the Noweb file (normally a file in the \SpecialChar LyX
 temp directory) and the directory path of the original \SpecialChar LyX
 file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an implementation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that you can place in a directory on your path:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family sans
#!/bin/sh
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family sans
#
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family sans
notangle -Rbuild-script $1 | env NOWEB_SOURCE=$1 NOWEB_OUTPUT_DIR=$2 sh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next part of the converter setting is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Flags
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is to be set to
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
parselog=$$s/scripts/listerrors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will run any errors that are generated by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 process through the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

listerrors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The build will normally take place in \SpecialChar LyX
's temporary directory,
 so the files produced by the conversion will be in that directory.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will copy out what it regards as the `main' file,
 but the 
\family typewriter
Noweb->Program
\family default
 conversion may produce several files,
 and so most of these would then be deleted when \SpecialChar LyX
 was closed.
 This is why we pass in the NOWEB_OUTPUT_DIR environment variable so that the build-script chunk can place the generated files in that location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Build instructions in the document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last piece of the integration between \SpecialChar LyX
 and noweb is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 chunk.
 Generally,
 the instructions for building your program should be embedded in a chunk of its own.
 The noweb-specific 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 above uses the notangle command to look for this chunk (called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and runs its contents through 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sh
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically,
 such a chunk would look something like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<<build-script>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#!/bin/sh
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

if [ -z "${NOWEB_SOURCE}" ]
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

then
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

Debug extensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a new function implemented in the \SpecialChar LyX
 server,
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

server-goto-file-row" function,
 to be used with ddd/gdb or other debugger.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When debugging code with ddd/gdb,
 it is possible to invoke a text editor at the current execution position with a single key stroke.
 The default ddd configuration for that is shift-ctrl-V.
 It happens that you can define the editor command line invocation in ddd by accessing the 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar menuseparator
Preferences\SpecialChar menuseparator
Helpers
\family default
 dialog and changing the "Edit Sources" entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I take advantage of the newly created \SpecialChar LyX
 server function and this ddd feature,
 and set 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
echo "LYXCMD:monitor:server-goto-file-row:@FILE@ @LINE@" >~/.lyxpipe.in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this,
 whenever you are using ddd and find a point in the program that you want to edit,
 you just press shift-ctrl-V (in the ddd window),
 and ddd will forward this information to \SpecialChar LyX
 through the \SpecialChar LyX
 server and then the \SpecialChar LyX
 window will show the same file with the cursor at the same position ddd was pointing to.
 No more guessing or long scrolling to locate a point in the program back from debugging !
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note however that you must enable the \SpecialChar LyX
 server to get this feature working (it is disabled by default).

Colors customization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of colors in \SpecialChar LyX
 that can be customized in 
\family sans
Preferences
\family default
.
 One of the things that bothers people is the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 font color.
 The default color is red,
 since the chunks uses \SpecialChar LaTeX
 font,
 and there is a lot of chunks in literate documents,
 you may get tired of seeing everything in red.
 You can change it by going to the tabs 
\family sans
Look&Feel
\family default
,
 
\family sans
Colors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next thing is the visible presence of the newline character in the screen.
 You can choose the color of this particular character and make it blend in the background.
 I recommend you choosing a color that is close to the background but not equal,
 that way you still can see it is there,
 but it is not bothering you anymore.

\change_deleted 564990737 1671355343
You can do everything with \SpecialChar LyX
 that you can do with \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 However,
 \SpecialChar LyX
 cannot support every \SpecialChar LaTeX
 feature directly.
 But you can always use \SpecialChar TeX
 Code.
 This chapter shows you some more special things you might want to use.
 For other special things you can do with figures,
 tables,
 floats,
 boxes and notes,
