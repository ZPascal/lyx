<para>This section is somewhat out of date. Need to describe default master documents and how children are opened when the master is. [[FIXME]]</para>

<para>It is possible to set up cross-references between the different files. First, open all the files in question: let's call them A and B in a two file example, where B is included in A. Let's say you insert a label in A, then want to reference it in B. Open the cross-reference dialog whilst in document B, and you can select the &#8220;buffer&#8221; to use.</para>
